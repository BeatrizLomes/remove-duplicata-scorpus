Robot-assisted therapy (RAT) and serious games could be used to enhance functional recovery by providing simultaneous motor and cognitive rehabilitation. Objective: The aim of this study is to clinically validate the dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) mechanism of ROBiGAME, a robot serious game designed for simultaneous rehabilitation of motor impairments and hemispatial neglect. Methods: A proof of concept, with 24 participants in subacute and chronic stroke, was conducted using a 5-day protocol (two days were dedicated to assessment and three days to consecutive training sessions). Participants performed three consecutive ROBiGAME sessions during which overall task difficulty was determined through simultaneous DDA of motor and attentional parameters. Relationships between clinical and robotic assessment scores with respective task-difficulty parameters were analyzed using a multivariate regression model and a principal component analysis. Results: Game difficulty rapidly (within approximately thirty minutes) auto-adapted to match individual impairment levels. The relationship between task-difficulty parameters with motor (Fugl Meyer Assessment: r = 0.84 p < 0.05) and with attentional impairments (Bells test total omissions: r = 0.617 p < 0.05) showed that task-difficulty during RAT adapted to each participant’s degree of impairment. Principal component analysis identified two data subsets determining overall task-difficulty, one subset for motor and the other for cognitive functional evaluation scores with respective task-difficulty parameters. Conclusions: This proof of concept clinically validated a DDA mechanism and showed how task-difficulty adequately adapted to match individual degrees of impairment during RAT after stroke. ROBiGAME provided simultaneous motor and attentional exercises with parameters determining task-difficulty strongly related with respective clinical and robotic evaluation scores. Individualized levels of game difficulty and rapid adjustment of the system suggest implementation in clinical practice.

Developed through a co-design process with therapists, engineers, parents and children, two IMU-equipped brick form factors transmit 70 Hz motion data via Bluetooth to a tablet hosting fifteen progressively challenging 3D assembly tasks enriched with rewards and audiovisual feedback. In a clinical feasibility trial, 30 children (mean age 9.1 ± 1.0 years) performed each model twice under supervision; synchronized motion and video data were annotated to train signal-processing routines and deep-learning classifiers. Signal processing detected all 36 movement and fall events (one false positive), while the Transformer model outperformed other approaches, achieving 86.0% multi-class accuracy and 85–96% binary accuracy across activity labels. These results demonstrate CPLAY's ability to objectively detect and classify key rehabilitation movements, paving the way for adaptive, AI-driven therapy, with future work focused on embedding a recommendation engine, scaling trials and refining AI models. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Intelligence; Gamification; Rehabilitation; Wearables; Article; Artificial Intelligence; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Clinical Article; Controlled Study; Deep Learning; Developmental Coordination Disorder; Female; Human; Limb Rehabilitation; Male; Motion; Parent; Signal Processing; Upper Limb,Article; artificial intelligence; cerebral palsy; child; clinical article; controlled study; deep learning; developmental coordination disorder; female; human; limb rehabilitation; male; motion; parent; signal processing; upper limb

Hand movement disorders require long-term rehabilitation and regular functional assessment. Currently, the primary method of assessing a patient's motor function involves clinicians instructing patients to complete tasks on an exercise scale. However, when patients undergo in-home rehabilitation, clinicians cannot regularly assess them, limiting the effectiveness of rehabilitation training. Hence, this study introduces a serious game that automatically assesses the degree of hand-motor impairment in stroke patients. The game involves four virtual guided tasks for hand motor function assessment, where each task requires completing different hand motions. Based on the clinician's expertise, the hand motions constructed correspond to motor features that reflect the functional indicators of the patient's hand. These motor characteristics correlate significantly with the Wolf Motor Function Test, primarily used to assess upper limb motor function in hemiplegic patients. The proposed method is based on experimental data from 10 healthy participants and 17 stroke patients with hemiplegia. The results show that this serious game can effectively discriminate between healthy individuals and patients with severe, moderate or mild hemiplegia. Furthermore, this game-based assessment method is easily applicable to home rehabilitation scenarios and the majority of users have a positive attitude towards it. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Hand Motor Function Assessment; Home Rehabilitation; Serious Game; Stroke; Brain; Functional Assessment; Human Computer Interaction; Human Engineering; Interactive Computer Graphics; Neuromuscular Rehabilitation; Brain Areas; Functionals; Hand Motion; Hand Motor Function Assessment; Home Rehabilitation; Motor Function; Movement Disorders; Stroke; Stroke Patients; Upper Limbs; Serious Games,Brain; Functional assessment; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Interactive computer graphics; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Brain areas; Functionals; Hand motion; Hand motor function assessment; Home rehabilitation; Motor function; Movement disorders; Stroke; Stroke patients; Upper limbs; Serious games

Effective rehabilitation is essential to restore function and improve quality of life. Traditional therapies, while useful, may lack engagement, leading to low motivation and poor adherence. Gamification—using game-like elements in non-game contexts—offers a promising way to make rehabilitation more engaging. The authors explore a gamified rehabilitation system designed in Unity 3D using a Kinect V2 camera. The game includes key features such as adjustable difficulty, real-time and predominantly positive feedback, user friendliness, and data tracking for progress. The evaluations were conducted with 18 healthy participants, most of whom had prior virtual reality experience. About 77% found the application highly motivating. While the gameplay was well received, the visual design was noted as lacking engagement. Importantly, all users agreed that the game offers a broad range of difficulty levels, making it accessible to various users. The results suggest that the system has strong potential to improve rehabilitation outcomes and encourage long-term use through enhanced motivation and interactivity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Gamification; Kinect V2; Quality Of Life; Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Stroke; Unity; Upper Limb; Feedback; Gamification; Human Computer Interaction; Interactive Computer Graphics; Motivation; Neuromuscular Rehabilitation; Virtual Reality; Daily Tasks; Kinect V2; Motor Impairments; Post-stroke Rehabilitation; Quality Of Life; Stroke; Unity; Upper Limbs; Video-games; Serious Games,Feedback; Gamification; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Motivation; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Virtual reality; Daily tasks; Kinect v2; Motor impairments; Post-stroke rehabilitation; Quality of life; Stroke; Unity; Upper limbs; Video-games; Serious games

This scoping review aimed to investigate the game controllers (GCs) employed in exergame systems used for rehabilitation, offering insights into the platforms, sensors, and techniques used in their development, implementation, and utilization. We conducted a comprehensive search of Scopus and PubMed databases, encompassing articles published between February 2013 and February 2023. The eligibility criteria included studies on upper limbs (UL) rehabilitation using exergames published in English-language journals, resulting in the identification of 175 pertinent articles. Seven key categories were identified: pathology, participants’ conditions, dosage of sessions, GCs, sensors, specific part of the UL rehabilitated, and ergonomics. Stroke (55.4%) and cerebral palsy (6.3%) were the most frequently addressed medical conditions in the exergame-based rehabilitation. The number of participants in the reviewed articles was from one to several hundred. Three types of participants were identified: patients, specialists, and volunteers. Randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies consistently featured a controlled number of sessions (ranging from 6 to 40) lasting an average of 20 minutes, while non-RCT studies displayed more variability. Commercial platforms were favored, accounting for 74.3% of GCs, with physical controllers (57.1%) surpassing virtual ones. Cameras were the predominant sensors (50.3%), although a wide array of sensor types including IMUs, push buttons, and force sensors were also used. Rehabilitation focuses 68% on general UL, 20.6% on hands, 4% on elbows, and 3.4% on arms and shoulders. Notably, only 26.3% of the studies considered ergonomics in the rehabilitation system. Although exergame systems are advancing rehabilitation treatments, there remains a need for further development and research on various aspects, such as ergonomics, controller design, and sensor integration, to enhance their suitability for patient use. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Exergames Technology; Games For Health; Review; Serious Games; Upper Extremities Rehabilitation; Upper Limbs Rehabilitation; Devices; Exergaming; Human; Pathophysiology; Procedures; Psychology; Rehabilitation; Upper Limb; Video Game; Exergaming; Humans; Rehabilitation; Upper Extremity; Video Games,devices; exergaming; human; pathophysiology; procedures; psychology; rehabilitation; upper limb; video game; Exergaming; Humans; Rehabilitation; Upper Extremity; Video Games

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effects of an innovative person-centred training based on eye-tracking computerised serious games on the social-emotional abilities in these individuals with PIMD. Nine participants aged 7–18 years were followed over a period of 1 year. A pre-test (T1) – training – post-test (T2) design was used. During T1 and T2, visual attention and six social-emotional abilities (preferential attention to biological motion, social orienting, facial expression exploration, emotional faces discrimination, joint attention and socio-moral evaluations) were assessed using an eye-tracking-based experimental paradigm combining various visual preference tasks. During the training, each participant benefited from personalized one-to-one sessions tailored to their skills based on results of T1 and the observations of their practitioners. To implement person-centred training, the experimenter chose from a set of serious games to train these social-emotional abilities, those he felt were best suited to the participant's current state of heath and alertness, personal skills and specific needs. All participants improved their visual exploration between T1 and T2. In addition, they all made progress on at least one of the six social-emotional competencies. These results showed preliminary evidence that it is possible to increase some social-emotional abilities in these individuals with an adapted training, thus indicating that they also have unsuspected learning abilities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Eye-tracking; Learning Abilities; Profound Intellectual And Multiple Disabilities; Social-emotional Training; Adolescent; Attention; Child; Disabled Child; Emotion; Eye-tracking Technology; Facial Expression; Female; Human; Intellectual Impairment; Male; Physiology; Pilot Study; Psychology; Rehabilitation; Social Competence; Video Game; Adolescent; Attention; Child; Children With Disabilities; Emotions; Eye-tracking Technology; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Intellectual Disability; Male; Pilot Projects; Social Skills; Video Games,adolescent; attention; child; disabled child; emotion; eye-tracking technology; facial expression; female; human; intellectual impairment; male; physiology; pilot study; psychology; rehabilitation; social competence; video game; Adolescent; Attention; Child; Children with Disabilities; Emotions; Eye-Tracking Technology; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Intellectual Disability; Male; Pilot Projects; Social Skills; Video Games

To assist in the facial rehabilitation process, gamified tools (GTs) have been proposed to promote stimulation and engagement in affected patients. This study provides a comprehensive review on the use of GTs to aid facial rehabilitation, with the aim of investigating the potential of such computer-based tools to motivate facial mime exercises. A systematic search conducted on May 22, 2024, across five databases (Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and MEDLINE/PubMed) returned 1043 articles. The selection of studies resulted in 15 articles included for analysis, most of which were intended for patients recovering from FP. Bell’s palsy, paralysis resulting from stroke, orofacial apraxia, and cerebral palsy were the patient disorders addressed in the articles. Facial mimic movements used for rehabilitation varied, the main actions considered in the studies were opening and closing the eyes, smiling, and raising the eyebrows. Studies focused on developing tools and conducting experiments with participants. Despite advances made by the selected studies, proposed computer-based tools for facial rehabilitation have not yet reached the necessary maturity for their use in clinical settings. Consequently, additional efforts are needed to perform new studies to mitigate the challenges presented in this research area. Therefore, this is a constantly evolving area of research and offers a huge window of opportunity for further research. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Augmented Reality; Facial Disorders; Facial Rehabilitation; Mime Therapy; Serious Games; Virtual Reality; Facial Nerve Paralysis; Human; Kinesiotherapy; Procedures; Psychology; Rehabilitation; Video Game; Exercise Therapy; Facial Paralysis; Humans; Video Games,facial nerve paralysis; human; kinesiotherapy; procedures; psychology; rehabilitation; video game; Exercise Therapy; Facial Paralysis; Humans; Video Games

A wealth of research has established that the integration of motor and cognitive training modalities can substantially enhance the rehabilitation process. Nevertheless, accurately assessing patients’ motor and cognitive statuses remains a significant challenge for current methodologies, thereby impeding real-time monitoring and adaptive adjustments to the rehabilitation regimen. In this work, we introduce a personalized motor-cognitive training framework anchored in serious gaming. Leveraging dynamic system theory, our framework is capable of extracting interpretable dynamic characteristics from the human-robot interaction, enabling a precise evaluation of subjects’ motor skill abilities. The training parameters can be dynamically tuned with the assessed skill levels, which supports multidimensional personalized rehabilitation. Building upon this approach, we have engineered an innovative motor-cognitive rehabilitation platform that synergizes serious games with robotic movement interaction. We have conducted experiments to validate the platform’s efficacy, demonstrating its potential to advance the field of post-stroke rehabilitation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Deterministic Learning; Dynamical Systems Theory; Human-robot Interaction; Motor Re-learning; Cognitive Systems; Contrastive Learning; Game Design; Human Rehabilitation Engineering; Man Machine Systems; Robot Learning; Serious Games; Structural Dynamics; Systems Analysis; Cognitive Human-robot Interactions; Cognitive Training; Deterministic Learning; Dynamical System Theory; Humans-robot Interactions; Motor Impairments; Motor Re-learning; Skill Levels; Stroke Patients; Human Robot Interaction,Cognitive systems; Contrastive Learning; Game design; Human rehabilitation engineering; Man machine systems; Robot learning; Serious games; Structural dynamics; Systems analysis; Cognitive human-robot interactions; Cognitive training; Deterministic learning; Dynamical system theory; Humans-robot interactions; Motor impairments; Motor re-learning; Skill levels; Stroke patients; Human robot interaction

Specifically, it focuses on game-based telerehabilitation for patients with stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis undergoing home-based rehabilitation. Utilising the PICO approach, a search in Scopus and PubMed until February 21st, 2024, identified 31 relevant English articles out of 258 initially considered. The study employed three independent reviewers to select, extract data, and analyse studies based on the research question. The final included studies were analysed to extract and categorise the most critical items, including rehabilitation tools, opportunities, and challenges. Of the 258 studies, 31 met the eligibility criteria, with the majority conducted in the United States and the United Kingdom. Key opportunities identified include the effectiveness of telerehabilitation and the use of new, engaging, user-friendly, and affordable technologies. However, challenges such as motivation, usability, exercise adherence, and technical barriers were significant. The Wii gaming console emerged as the most commonly used telerehabilitation device. This systematic review offers a comprehensive analysis of telerehabilitation features, opportunities, and challenges.

Robot-assisted rehabilitation facilitates the restoration mobility and dexterity, promotes functional neuroplasticity and potentially enables workforce reentry through training-induced cognitive and motor learning. To boost participant engagement and visuomotor coordination, we propose ArmGuider Pro, an advanced upper-limb training system that integrates hand-eye collaboration and gazetriggered assistance within rehabilitation-tailored serious games. The system implements intuitive eye-tracking and visualtriggering strategies to align therapeutic interventions with participants' intentional focus, incorporating immersive gaming elements and adaptive control algorithms. Experimental validation demonstrates significant activation in motor and cognitive cerebral cortex regions, enhanced visual attention concentration in desired target areas (25.92 % improvement), and improved trajectory adherence across sequential sessions (27.27 % improvement). By harnessing visual attention valence, our proposed system could encourage neuroplasticity, supporting its viability for clinical application and widespread adaption in rehabilitation regimens. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Brain; Cognitive Systems; Neuromuscular Rehabilitation; Robotics; Serious Games; Eye-tracking; Gamification; Motor Impairments; Neuroplasticity; Physical Rehabilitation; Robot-assisted Rehabilitation; Robotic Rehabilitation; Robotic Systems; Upper Limbs; Visual Attention; Eye Tracking,Brain; Cognitive systems; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Robotics; Serious games; Eye-tracking; Gamification; Motor impairments; Neuroplasticity; Physical rehabilitation; Robot-assisted rehabilitation; Robotic rehabilitation; Robotic systems; Upper limbs; Visual Attention; Eye tracking

Approaches focused on neuromuscular reeducation and functional recovery have gained prominence with the use of technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR), Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES), and Neurofeedback (NFB) via EEG. These systems propose innovative and personalized approaches to motor rehabilitation, increasing patient engagement and long-term outcomes. This study proposes an intervention for upper limb rehabilitation in tetraplegic individuals using an immersive VR-based serious game with visual neurofeed-back through EEG and FES. Two healthy right-handed male volunteers, without reported motor impairment in any upper limb, participated in the study. The experimental protocol includes two conditions: Baseline (BL) with VR + FES, involving passive movements, and VR + FES + Kinesthetic Motor Imagery (KMI), combining passive movements with KMI corresponding to the gripping movement, with defined repetitions and rest intervals. The observed results exhibited distinct brain patterns when comparing the baseline with respect to right and left MI upper limbs. As a pilot study, the findings present potential for use as biomarkers for limb distinction during motor tasks, potentially useful in more complex activities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Brain-computer Interface; Eeg; Functional Electrical Stimulation; Motor Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Tetraplegia; Virtual Reality; Brain; Electroencephalography; Functional Electric Stimulation; Interfaces (computer); Neuromuscular Rehabilitation; Functional Electri-cal Stimulations; Hand Function; Kinesthetics; Motor Imagery; Motor Rehabilitation; Neurofeedback; Passive Movement; Pilot Studies; Tetraplegia; Upper Limbs; Brain Computer Interface; Serious Games; Virtual Reality,Brain; Electroencephalography; Functional electric stimulation; Interfaces (computer); Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Functional electri-cal stimulations; Hand function; Kinesthetics; Motor imagery; Motor rehabilitation; Neurofeedback; Passive movement; Pilot studies; Tetraplegia; Upper limbs; Brain computer interface; Serious games; Virtual reality

An experimental case study was conducted at the volunteer's residence. The participant, diagnosed with bilateral bursitis and reduced shoulder ROM, and mild cognitive decline, was subjected to an intervention protocol based on serious games. Physical and cognitive assessments were conducted before and after the implementation of the protocol, including measurements of range of motion (goniometry), flexibility (sit and reach test), endurance (elbow flexion test), and cognition (tests to evaluate cognitive abilities and reaction time). The intervention consisted of 8 sessions over 4 weeks, with sessions lasting 20 min each, conducted twice a week. After the intervention with serious games, significant improvements were observed in shoulder range of motion, with notable gains in flexion, adduction, abduction, internal rotation, and external rotation. Additionally, there were improvements in flexibility, muscular endurance with a substantial increase in the number of elbow flexions, and cognitive abilities, with a decrease in reaction time. The results of this study are consistent with previous research highlighting the effectiveness of technological approaches in rehabilitation. It is concluded that the use of serious games as part of the intervention protocol proved effective in improving the range of motion and cognition of a patient with reduced mobility and mild cognitive decline. This study provided evidence of the potential of serious games as an innovative therapeutic approach in physical and cognitive rehabilitation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cognition; Elderly; Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Shoulder Pain; Virtual Reality; Cognitive Systems; Diseases; Function Evaluation; Neuromuscular Rehabilitation; Patient Treatment; Time And Motion Study; Case-studies; Cognition; Cognitive Ability; Cognitive Assessments; Cognitive Decline; Cognitive Functions; Elderly; Range-of-motion; Shoulder Pain; Upper-limb Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Virtual Reality,Cognitive systems; Diseases; Function evaluation; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Patient treatment; Time and motion study; Case-studies; Cognition; Cognitive ability; Cognitive assessments; Cognitive decline; Cognitive functions; Elderly; Range-of-motion; Shoulder pain; Upper-limb rehabilitation; Serious games; Virtual reality

Modern VR technologies can further enhance usability, allowing the participant to seamlessly interact with VR environment with bare hands, without need of external tracking systems and complex setups. In children neurorheabilitation engagement can promote motivation and attention to the exercise, two key elements for effectiveness of the rehabilitation process. In this work we developed a rehabilitation system composed of three serious games in immersive VR, with motor exercises targeting the upper limb and trunk in children with Cerebral Palsy. The participant plays in the role of a wizard apprentice, called to cast spells, to prepare potions and to ride a magic eagle. These game scenarios involve coordinated motor functions related to trajectory tracking, pick-and-place with prono-supination, and trunk balance. The presented pilot study (12 CP children, 24 sessions), focuses on the feasibility assessment of the rehabilitation method, then, it allows a more in depth analysis on the adaptation and progress of the exercise parameters through data recorded during the whole treatment. The study shows that immersive VR games are a feasible approach in rehabilitation procedures, with positive results regarding acceptability, retention, adherence to the planned exercises and absence of adverse effects in the long-term use. They also show promising results in improvements of motor functions, although a direct comparison with a control group was not included in the study. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cerebral Palsy; Haptics; Immersive; Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Virtual Reality; Wearable; Apprentices; Engineering Education; Human Computer Interaction; Neuromuscular Rehabilitation; Cerebral Palsy; Children With Cerebral Palsies; Game System; Haptics; Immersive; Immersive Vr; Motor Function; Rehabilitation Exercise; Vr Technology; Wearable; Serious Games; Virtual Reality; Adaptation; Adolescent; Article; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Clinical Assessment; Exercise; Female; Game; Human; Likert Scale; Male; Motivation; Motor Performance; Pilot Study; Rehabilitation Care; Social Acceptance; Student; Supination; Upper Limb; Virtual Reality; Wizard Apprentice; Feasibility Study; Kinesiotherapy; Pathophysiology; Procedures; Rehabilitation; Treatment Outcome; Video Game; Adolescent; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Exercise Therapy; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Pilot Projects; Treatment Outcome; Upper Extremity; Video Games; Virtual Reality,Apprentices; Engineering education; Human computer interaction; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Cerebral palsy; Children with cerebral palsies; Game system; Haptics; Immersive; Immersive VR; Motor function; Rehabilitation exercise; VR technology; Wearable; Serious games; Virtual reality; adaptation; adolescent; Article; cerebral palsy; child; clinical assessment; exercise; female; game; human; Likert scale; male; motivation; motor performance; pilot study; rehabilitation care; social acceptance; student; supination; upper limb; virtual reality; Wizard apprentice; feasibility study; kinesiotherapy; pathophysiology; procedures; rehabilitation; treatment outcome; video game; Adolescent; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Exercise Therapy; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Pilot Projects; Treatment Outcome; Upper Extremity; Video Games; Virtual Reality

A robust calibration process ensures accurate hand pose recognition, facilitating seamless user input during gameplay. The MR Treadmill game, a core component of the platform, encourages repetitive hand movements through interactive challenges set in a visually enriched environment. Data collected during sessions are relayed to the TR Portal, enabling clinicians to monitor patient progress and adapt gameplay to improve therapeutic outcomes.

Serious Games (SGs) have emerged as a promising tool to enhance patient motivation. This study evaluates Painting Discovery, a projected augmented reality (AR) SG for shoulder rehabilitation, assessing engagement, ergonomics, and its potential to differentiate motor performance between healthy and those with rheumatoid arthritis, bursitis, subacromial impingement, rotator cuff tear, or calcific tendinopathy. Additionally, it examines improvements in pathological subjects following physiotherapy. Method: Sixteen healthy and seven pathological subjects participated. Engagement, ergonomics, and satisfaction were assessed using Likert-scale questionnaires. Motor performance was evaluated through completion time, speed, acceleration, and normalized jerk. Four pathological subjects underwent pre- and post-physiotherapy assessments over six weeks. Results: SG was highly engaging and ergonomic, with no significant differences based on prior video game or AR experience. The pathological group had longer completion times ( 56.49± 37.85 s vs. 39.02 ± 24.21 s, p < 0.001), lower acceleration ( 1.11 ± 0.92 m/s2 vs. 0.79 ± 0.56 m/s2, p < 0.001), and higher jerk ( 6.68 × 107 ± 1.37 × 108 m/s3 vs. 9.22 × 106 ± 2.51 × 107 m/s3, p = 0.025) then healthy subjects. After physiotherapy, completion time and normalized jerk indicated enhanced efficiency and control. Conclusions: Painting Discovery shows strong potential as an engaging, accessible rehabilitation tool. While effective in differentiating motor impairments, its small sample size and horizontal-plane movement focus limit broader conclusions. Future studies should expand participation, incorporate vertical-plane movements, and refine performance metrics for clinical validation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Hand-finger Tracking; Projected Augmented Reality; Rehabilitation; Serious Game; Shoulder Disorders.; Augmented Reality; Diseases; Ergonomics; Neuromuscular Rehabilitation; Pathology; Shoulders (road); Completion Time; Hand Fingers; Hand-finger Tracking; Motor Performance; Projected Augmented Reality; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Rotator Cuff; Shoulder Disorder; Shoulder Rehabilitations; Upper Limbs; Serious Games; Adult; Aged; Article; Augmented Reality; Bursitis; Calcification; Chronic Pain; Clinical Article; Controlled Study; Disability; Ergonomics; Female; Human; Male; Motor Performance; Numeric Rating Scale; Observational Study; Patient Engagement; Physiotherapist; Physiotherapy; Projected Augmented Reality; Prospective Study; Rehabilitation Care; Rehabilitation Center; Rehabilitation Protocol; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Rotator Cuff Rupture; Shoulder Arthritis; Shoulder Disease; Shoulder Impingement Syndrome; Task Performance; Tendinitis; Upper Limb; Video Game; Middle Aged; Pathophysiology; Physiology; Rehabilitation; Shoulder; Shoulder Pain; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Physical Therapists; Physical Therapy Modalities; Shoulder; Shoulder Pain; Video Games,Augmented reality; Diseases; Ergonomics; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Pathology; Shoulders (road); Completion time; Hand fingers; Hand-finger tracking; Motor performance; Projected augmented reality; Rheumatoid arthritis; Rotator cuff; Shoulder disorder; Shoulder rehabilitations; Upper limbs; Serious games; adult; aged; Article; augmented reality; bursitis; calcification; chronic pain; clinical article; controlled study; disability; ergonomics; female; human; male; motor performance; numeric rating scale; observational study; patient engagement; physiotherapist; physiotherapy; projected augmented reality; prospective study; rehabilitation care; rehabilitation center; rehabilitation protocol; rheumatoid arthritis; rotator cuff rupture; shoulder arthritis; shoulder disease; shoulder impingement syndrome; task performance; tendinitis; upper limb; video game; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; rehabilitation; shoulder; shoulder pain; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Physical Therapists; Physical Therapy Modalities; Shoulder; Shoulder Pain; Video Games

The Serious Games (SG) are an interesting therapeutic option, as they allow the performance of exercises according to stroke treatment guidelines. However, there is little research exploring the evaluation potential of SG. This study aimed to evaluate the possible metric properties of the mim-pong SG in addition to the therapeutic effects. Methods: Twenty-four hemiparetic stroke patients were divided into two non-randomized groups: the experimental group (EG) (n = 16) and the control group (CG) (n = 8). Participants were evaluated in terms of motor impairment (lower limb), muscle strength (MS), motor control, and functional mobility. Results: The significant correlations observed between the score generated by the SG and clinical variables in both groups are highlighted, especially with MS (rho = 0.62-0.66; p = 0.000, and rho = 0.67-0.71; p = 0.002-0.005, for the experimental and CGs, respectively) and motor function of the lower limb for the EG (rho = 0.41, p = 0.018).

Materials and Methods: Design thinking guided our technology development with knowledge holders. User- and theory-informed design needs were defined by empathizing with users through observation, interviews and literature review. Solutions were ideated through sketches that led to prototypes. Informal testing with knowledge holders was conducted before formal usability testing with 7 school-aged children (5 neurotypical, 2 with cerebral palsy). Children practiced exercises using the technology before completing a study-specific survey (5-point Likert scales and open-ended questions) that was analyzed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. Results: Bootle Boot Camp, an interactive therapy game that enables clinicians to prescribe customized home exercise programs, was created. Through exercise videos, motion tracking, multimodal feedback that fades to summary, self-controlled form (i.e., star ratings) based on a child’s performance, rewards and training resources, the game aims to promote safe and high-quality exercise according to design needs. Children found feedback helpful (mean 3.7/5) and audio cues easy to understand (mean 4.6/5). Users’ recommendations to improve audio feedback delivery guided game refinements. Conclusions: Application of the design thinking methodology supported robust end-user involvement that facilitated development of a user-friendly technology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cerebral Palsy; Design Thinking; Exercise (exercise Therapy); Gaming; Home-based Rehabilitation; Virtual Applications; Virtual Reality; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Female; Home Care; Human; Kinesiotherapy; Male; Procedures; Rehabilitation; Video Game; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Exercise Therapy; Female; Home Care Services; Humans; Male; Video Games,cerebral palsy; child; female; home care; human; kinesiotherapy; male; procedures; rehabilitation; video game; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Exercise Therapy; Female; Home Care Services; Humans; Male; Video Games

However, the lack of commercial video games suitable for children with disabilities and the disappointing user experience of serious games limit their applicability. The aim of this study was to assess the usability, acceptability and user experience of GiocAbile, an active video game for children with cerebral palsy (CP). Methods: This multicenter pilot observational study was conducted from May to September 2022 at the participating institutions, and enrolled school-aged children affected by CP. Enrolled children played GiocAbile in single-player mode for one hour. The gaming experience was evaluated through self-assessment questionnaires. Non-parametric correlation analysis was conducted to examine the influence of motor and cognitive abilities (GMFCS, MACS, ICF) on declared usability and acceptability. Results: Nineteen children (9.01 ± 1.95 years, 63.1% male) with mild to severe CP were enrolled. The 100% of respondents expressed satisfaction and fulfillment associated with gameplay, with no reports of frustration or disappointment. The 83% would recommend the game to a friend. The controllers were generally deemed easy to use and maneuver, with very few reports of discomfort associated with their use. No correlations were found between usability/acceptability levels and measures of impairment (i.e., GMFCS, MACS, and ICF scales), while cognitive impairment positively correlated with satisfaction during gameplay. Conclusions: GiocAbile is an accessible, user-friendly and enjoyable tool for children with CP, regardless of level of impairment. Based on existing literature, we hypothesize that GiocAbile may improve motivation, participation, and rehabilitation outcomes in children with CP, although further studies are needed to confirm our hypothesis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accessibility; Cerebral Palsy; Design4all; Disability; Gamification; Neuromotor Impairment; Videogames; Giocabile; Phicube; Playcuff; Article; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Clinical Article; Cognitive Defect; Disease Severity; Female; Gamification; Gross Motor Function Classification System; Human; International Classification Of Functioning, Disability And Health; Male; Manual Ability Classification System; Motor Dysfunction; Motor Dysfunction Assessment; Observational Study; Patient Satisfaction; Pilot Study; Play; Program Acceptability; School Child; Usability; Video Game; Clinical Trial; Multicenter Study; Questionnaire; Rehabilitation; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Patient Satisfaction; Pilot Projects; Surveys And Questionnaires; Video Games","Article; cerebral palsy; child; clinical article; cognitive defect; disease severity; female; gamification; Gross Motor Function Classification System; human; International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health; male; Manual Ability Classification System; motor dysfunction; motor dysfunction assessment; observational study; patient satisfaction; pilot study; play; program acceptability; school child; usability; video game; clinical trial; multicenter study; questionnaire; rehabilitation; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Patient Satisfaction; Pilot Projects; Surveys and Questionnaires; Video Games"

Individualized goal-directed and repetitive physical practice is an important determinant of motor learning. Yet, many investigations of motor learning after stroke deliver task practice without consideration of individual capability of the learner. Objective: We developed a gamified arm rehabilitation task for people with stroke that is personalized to individual capacity for paretic arm movement, provides a high dose of practice, progresses through increasingly difficulty levels that are dependent on the performance of the individual, and is practiced in an engaging environment. The objectives of the current study were to determine if 10 days of gamified, object intercept training using the paretic arm would improve arm movement speed and clinical outcome measures of impairment or function. Methods: Individuals with chronic stroke and age-matched controls engaged in 10 days of gamified, skilled motor practice of a semi-immersive virtual reality-based intercept and release task. The paretic arm was assessed using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (motor impairment) and Wolf Motor Function Test (motor function) before and after training. Results: Both groups showed faster arm movement speed with practice; individuals with stroke demonstrated reduced paretic arm motor impairment and increased function after the intervention. Age and sex (for both groups), and time post-stroke were not related to changes in movement speed. Conclusions: Findings indicate that gamified motor training positively affects paretic arm motor behavior in individuals with mild to severe chronic stroke. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gamified Rehabilitation; Motor Function; Motor Learning; Stroke; Adult; Aged; Arm Movement; Article; Cerebrovascular Accident; Clinical Article; Controlled Study; Female; Fugl-meyer Assessment; Game-based Learning; Human; Locomotion; Male; Motor Function Test; Motor Performance; Paresis; Stroke Rehabilitation; Velocity; Arm; Complication; Etiology; Middle Aged; Motor Activity; Outcome Assessment; Pathophysiology; Physiology; Procedures; Psychomotor Performance; Rehabilitation; Video Game; Adult; Aged; Arm; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Activity; Motor Skills; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Paresis; Psychomotor Performance; Stroke; Stroke Rehabilitation; Video Games","adult; aged; arm movement; Article; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; controlled study; female; Fugl-Meyer assessment; game-based learning; human; locomotion; male; motor function test; motor performance; paresis; stroke rehabilitation; velocity; arm; complication; etiology; middle aged; motor activity; outcome assessment; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; psychomotor performance; rehabilitation; video game; Adult; Aged; Arm; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Activity; Motor Skills; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Paresis; Psychomotor Performance; Stroke; Stroke Rehabilitation; Video Games"

Immersive learning environments often simulate real working-life situations so that students can practice in a safe environment. Older adults should be included in the technologizing society also in the form of VR games. Furthermore, understanding of how educational games are accessible to older adults is still limited. It is thought that there are general barriers to older adults' use of (game) technology, such as negative psychological perception of technology, as well as physiological barriers due to visual, hearing, and other physical disabilities. Hence, this article examines the utilization of educational and entertainment VR games and their perceived ease of use according to four accessibility principles among older adults. The results of this qualitative study are based on data analysis based on structured qualitative measures observations and interviews. The results point to several issues related to accessibility such as VR headsets not fitting user heads, intuitive game controls, and differences in mechanics understandability between entertainment and educational VR games. The lack of hand visibility made the educational VR game harder to control. The study revealed that participants with more experience using a smartphone and a computer knew how to use the VR game controls without problems. Using a game controller produced issues for the participants who did not own a smartphone. However, like the younger audience, the older adults seem eager to participate in educational VR games and entertainment VR games. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Accessibility; Educational Vr Games; Older Adults; Vr Games; Audition; Accessibility; Educational Contents; Educational Vr Game; Immersive Learning; Learning Environments; Older Adults; Primary Schools; Smart Phones; University Levels; Vr Game; Entertainment,Audition; Accessibility; Educational contents; Educational VR game; Immersive learning; Learning environments; Older adults; Primary schools; Smart phones; University levels; VR game; Entertainment

An additional aim was to better understand the influence of muscle shortening on function. Thirty children with USCP (age 7.6 ± 2.1 years) received four weeks of EMGs_SG sessions 2×/week including repetitive, active alternating training of dorsi- and plantar flexors in a seated position. In addition, each child received usual PT treatment ≤ 2×/week, involving plantar flexor stretching and command strengthening on dorsi- and plantar flexors. Five-Step Assessment parameters, including preferred gait velocity (normalized by height); plantar flexor extensibility (XV1); angle of catch (XV3); maximal active ankle dorsiflexion (XA); and derived coefficients of shortening, spasticity, and weakness for both soleus and gastrosoleus complex (GSC) were compared pre and post treatment (t-tests). Correlations were explored between the various coefficients and gait velocities at baseline. After four weeks of EMGs_SG + PT, there was an increase in normalized gait velocity from 0.72 ± 0.13 to 0.77 ± 0.13 m/s (p = 0.025, d = 0.43), a decrease in coefficients of shortening (soleus, 0.10 ± 0.07 pre vs. 0.07 ± 0.08 post, p = 0.004, d = 0.57; GSC 0.16 ± 0.08 vs. 0.13 ± 0.08, p = 0.003, d = 0.58), spasticity (soleus 0.14 ± 0.06 vs. 0.12 ± 0.07, p = 0.02, d = 0.46), and weakness (soleus 0.14 ± 0.07 vs. 0.11 ± 0.07, p = 0.005, d = 0.55). At baseline, normalized gait velocity correlated with the coefficient of GSC shortening (R = −0.43, p = 0.02).

Traditional techniques present problems regarding access to personalized care, patient engagement and the discrete nature of weights used during therapy. In this paper, we present a new home-based upper limb gaming rehabilitation robotic system. The system is modular, and designed to be suitable to a large variety of use cases. A module responsible for power and control which can be fixed to a regular table can be paired to a wide array of exercise modules in order to apply different types of exercises to different joints. Two exercise modules were developed, one for wrist and other for shoulder and elbow exercises. For each of them, a computer serious game was designed, in order to make rehabilitation sessions enjoyable and intuitive. The computer recognizes the device as a generic joystick, allowing this system to be used with different operational systems and requires little configuration. Healthcare professionals can customize remotely the games and control modes (passive, assistive or resistive) to the patient's needs, and after each session, data are sent back for them to evaluate progress. Future developments would seek to increase the number of exercise modules and implement an AI to assess user effort in real-time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Arthroplasty; Disabled Persons; Game Design; Industrial Robots; Neuromuscular Rehabilitation; Robotic Arms; Home-based; Modulars; Motor Disability; Motor Rehabilitation; Quality Of Life; Rehabilitation Robot; Rehabilitation Robotic Systems; Traditional Techniques; Upper Limbs; Upper-limb Rehabilitation; Modular Robots,Arthroplasty; Disabled persons; Game design; Industrial robots; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Robotic arms; Home-based; Modulars; Motor disability; Motor rehabilitation; Quality of life; Rehabilitation robot; Rehabilitation robotic systems; Traditional techniques; Upper limbs; Upper-limb rehabilitation; Modular robots

Objective: In this study, we attempted to provide an updated scope of understanding of the development and evaluation of SG educational tools and develop a framework for SG education development to promote self-management activities and behavior change in children with chronic diseases. Methods: This study consists of a knowledge base and an analytical base. This study followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. To build the knowledge base, 5 stages of research were developed, including refining the review question (stage 1), searching for studies (stage 2), selecting relevant studies (stage 3), charting the information (stage 4), and collating the results (stage 5). Eligible studies that developed SG prototypes and evaluated SG education for children with chronic diseases were searched for in PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and peer-reviewed journals. In the analytical base, the context-mechanism-output approach and game taxonomy were used to analyze relevant behavioral theories and essential game elements. Game taxonomy included social features, presentation, narrative and identity, rewards and punishment, and manipulation and control. A total of 2 researchers selected the domains for the included behavioral theories and game elements. The intended SG framework was finalized by assembling SG fragments. Those SG fragments were appropriately reintegrated to visualize a new SG framework. Results: This scoping review summarized data from 16 randomized controlled trials that evaluated SG education for children with chronic diseases and 14 studies on SG frameworks. It showed that self-determination theory was the most commonly used behavioral theory (9/30, 30%). Game elements included feedback, visual and audio designs, characters, narratives, rewards, challenges, competitions, goals, levels, rules, and tasks. In total, 3 phases of a digital SG framework are proposed in this review: requirements (phase 1), design and development (phase 2), and evaluation (phase 3). A total of 6 steps are described: exploring SG requirements (step 1), identifying target users (step 2), designing an SG prototype (step 3), building the SG prototype (step 4), evaluating the SG prototype (step 5), and marketing and monitoring the use of the SG prototype (step 6). Safety recommendations to use digital SG-based education for children in the post–COVID-19 era were also made. Conclusions: This review summarizes the fundamental behavioral theories and game elements of the available literature to establish a new theory-driven step-by-step framework. It can support game designers, clinicians, and educators in designing, developing, and evaluating digital, SG-based educational tools to increase self-management activities and promote behavior change in children with chronic diseases. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Children; Chronic Disease; Digital Game; Patient Education; Serious Game; Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome; Asthma; Behavior Change; Behavioral Science; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Child Safety; Childhood Cancer; Childhood Obesity; Chronic Disease; Clinical Outcome; Cystic Fibrosis; Diabetes Mellitus; Digital Health Technology; Health Education; Human; Patient Compliance; Patient Education; Patient Engagement; Patient Satisfaction; Pediatrics; Practice Guideline; Randomized Controlled Trial (topic); Review; Self Care; Video Game; Adolescent; Procedures; Psychology; Adolescent; Child; Chronic Disease; Humans; Self-management; Video Games,acquired immune deficiency syndrome; asthma; behavior change; behavioral science; cerebral palsy; child; child safety; childhood cancer; childhood obesity; chronic disease; clinical outcome; cystic fibrosis; diabetes mellitus; digital health technology; health education; human; patient compliance; patient education; patient engagement; patient satisfaction; pediatrics; practice guideline; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; self care; video game; adolescent; procedures; psychology; Adolescent; Child; Chronic Disease; Humans; Self-Management; Video Games

Humanoid robot Pepper integrates advanced sensory technologies into this framework, leveraging empathetic interactions to foster children's motivation and engagement to assist. This innovative approach seeks to reverse the conventional dynamic in therapeutic care by empowering children to aid the robot, thereby potentially boosting their motivation and engagement. An observational study in a pediatric rehabilitation center, where therapists and children interacted during rehabilitation games/exercises, formed the basis of this study's methodological framework. Following a thematic analysis of these observations and previous studies findings, three empathic game scenarios were conceptualized. Through tablet interfaces enabled by IMU sensors, children assist the robot, creating a sense of accomplishment and agency among them. Despite the lack of direct experimental data with children-robot interaction, the paper describes the potential technical architecture of the system, including features such as real-time monitoring. Future empirical research on empathetic, interactive robotics in pediatric rehabilitation settings can build upon this framework to achieve further development and validation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Empathy; Human-robot Interaction; Rehab Game System; Rehabilitation; Anthropomorphic Robots; Human Robot Interaction; Motivation; Patient Rehabilitation; Children With Cerebral Palsies; Conceptual Frameworks; Empathy; Game System; Humanoid Robot; Humans-robot Interactions; Innovative Approaches; Motivation And Engagements; Rehab Game System; Sensory Technologies; Pediatrics,Anthropomorphic robots; Human robot interaction; Motivation; Patient rehabilitation; Children with cerebral palsies; Conceptual frameworks; Empathy; Game system; Humanoid robot; Humans-robot interactions; Innovative approaches; Motivation and engagements; Rehab game system; Sensory technologies; Pediatrics

What needs research and development to make sure no student is left behind? This literature study of research published between 2016 and 2020 (66 manuscripts) shows that researchers are directing relatively less attention towards motor and auditory accessibility.

This becomes more evident as the child grows and can be treated with physical therapy. The effectiveness of early interventions in facilitating an improvement in daily life activities varies depending on the child's condition. In this context, the use of exoskeletons has emerged in recent years as a valuable resource for conducting more efficient therapy processes. This work describes the design (both structural and functional) and preliminary usability and functional validation of a 3D-printed passive upper limb exoskeleton. The goal is to provide clinicians with an efficient, low-cost device that is both easy to manufacture and assemble and, in a gamified environment, serves as an assistive device to physical therapy. The device features 5 degrees of freedom, enabling both a pro-gravity and an anti-gravity mode, controlled by a series of elastic bands. This gives rise to a dual operating mode, offering assistance or resistance to different arm, forearm, and shoulder-dependent movements. Usability validation conducted by exoskeleton users showed average results in all aspects rated above 3.8 out of 5, which implies levels of satisfaction between 'quite satisfied' and 'very satisfied'. The analysis of metrics recorded during therapy, such as the Hand Path Ratio and Success Rate (capturing user movements using an inertial sensor in the gamified environment), as well as the range of motion, reveals quantifiable improvements which can be attributed to the use of the exoskeleton: the Hand Path Ratio tended to approach 1 throughout sessions in almost all the users, the Success Rate remained stable (as users consistently were capable of completing the assigned tasks), and the range of motion showed that all patients achieved improvements of more than 10 degrees in some of the tested movements). These functional validation processes involved the participation of 7 children with varying levels of upper limb neuro-motor impairments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Exoskeleton; Motor Disabilities; Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Upper Limb; 3d Printing; Degrees Of Freedom (mechanics); Diseases; Exoskeleton (robotics); Machine Design; Patient Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Elbow; Exoskeleton; Functional Validation; Medical Treatment; Motor Disability; Range-of-motion; Robot Sensing System; Shoulder; Upper Limbs; Diagnosis; Adult; Anthropometry; Article; Cerebral Palsy; Clinical Article; Elbow Flexion; Electromyography; Exoskeleton; Freedom; Gravity; Hand Function; Human; Motor Dysfunction; Motor Performance; Multiple Sclerosis; Muscle Atrophy; Muscular Dystrophy; Neurorehabilitation; Occupational Therapist; Physiotherapist; Physiotherapy; Range Of Motion; Rigidity; Spinal Muscular Atrophy; Three Dimensional Printing; Three-dimensional Imaging; Transverse Plane; Upper Limb; Upper Limb Exoskeleton; Virtual Reality; Adolescent; Biomechanics; Child; Devices; Equipment Design; Exoskeleton (rehabilitation); Female; Male; Pathophysiology; Rehabilitation; Reproducibility; Adolescent; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Equipment Design; Exoskeleton Device; Female; Humans; Male; Physical Therapy Modalities; Printing, Three-dimensional; Reproducibility Of Results; Upper Extremity","3D printing; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Diseases; Exoskeleton (Robotics); Machine design; Patient rehabilitation; Serious games; Elbow; Exoskeleton; Functional validation; Medical treatment; Motor disability; Range-of-motion; Robot sensing system; Shoulder; Upper limbs; Diagnosis; adult; anthropometry; Article; cerebral palsy; clinical article; elbow flexion; electromyography; exoskeleton; freedom; gravity; hand function; human; motor dysfunction; motor performance; multiple sclerosis; muscle atrophy; muscular dystrophy; neurorehabilitation; occupational therapist; physiotherapist; physiotherapy; range of motion; rigidity; spinal muscular atrophy; three dimensional printing; three-dimensional imaging; transverse plane; upper limb; upper limb exoskeleton; virtual reality; adolescent; biomechanics; child; devices; equipment design; exoskeleton (rehabilitation); female; male; pathophysiology; rehabilitation; reproducibility; Adolescent; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Equipment Design; Exoskeleton Device; Female; Humans; Male; Physical Therapy Modalities; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Reproducibility of Results; Upper Extremity"

Robot-based multiplayer gaming with virtual and haptic interaction may improve motivation, engagement, and implicit learning in robotic therapy. Over the past few years, there has been growing interest in robot mediated haptic dyads, or human-robot-robot-human interaction. The effect of such a paradigm on motor learning in general and specifically for individuals with motor and/or cognitive impairments is an open area of research. We reviewed the literature to investigate the effect of a robot-based haptic dyad on motor learning. Thirty-eight articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. We summarize study characteristics including device, haptic rendering, and experimental task. Our main findings indicate that dyadic training's impact on motor learning is inconsistent in that some studies show significant improvement of motor training while others show no influence. We also find that the relative skill level of the partner and interaction characteristics such as stiffness of connection and availability of visual information influence motor learning outcomes. We discuss implications for neurorehabilitation and conclude that additional research is needed to determine optimal interaction characteristics for motor learning and to extend this research to individuals with cognitive and motor impairments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Haptic Dyad; Haptics; Human Robot Human Interaction; Human Robot Interaction; Multiplayer Therapy Games; Neurological Impairments; Neurorehabilitation; Robotics; Human Robot Interaction; Job Analysis; Man Machine Systems; Game; Haptic Dyad; Haptics; Haptics Interfaces; Human Robot Human Interaction; Human Robots; Humans-robot Interactions; Multiplayer Therapy Game; Multiplayers; Neurological Impairment; Neurorehabilitation []; Robot-human Interaction; Task Analysis; Haptic Interfaces; Devices; Human; Learning; Motor Performance; Neurorehabilitation; Physiology; Procedures; Robotics; Touch; Humans; Learning; Motor Skills; Neurological Rehabilitation; Robotics; Touch Perception,Human robot interaction; Job analysis; Man machine systems; Game; Haptic dyad; Haptics; Haptics interfaces; Human robot human interaction; Human robots; Humans-robot interactions; Multiplayer therapy game; Multiplayers; Neurological impairment; Neurorehabilitation []; Robot-human interaction; Task analysis; Haptic interfaces; devices; human; learning; motor performance; neurorehabilitation; physiology; procedures; robotics; touch; Humans; Learning; Motor Skills; Neurological Rehabilitation; Robotics; Touch Perception

Recently, serious games have emerged as a potential option for rehabilitation therapy. However, to investigate the cognitive stimulation provided by serious games, it is crucial to conduct an individualized analysis of hemiparesis laterality. Therefore, the objective of this study is to compare electroencephalographic signals between typically developing children and those diagnosed with hemiparetic cerebral palsy while performing voluntary movements, both with and without the utilization of a serious game. A total of forty children, comprising 20 with hemiparetic cerebral palsy and 20 with typical development, were included in this study. Both genders were represented, and the participants' ages ranged from 6 to 14 years old. Data collection was conducted with and without the implementation of a serious game. This involved the acquisition of electroencephalographic signals and the capture of three-dimensional movement trajectories while performing a reaching motor task. Kinematic data were extracted from the movement trajectories, and the electroencephalographic data were processed to extract information on the synchronization and desynchronization patterns associated with mu and beta wave events. The collected data were subjected to statistical analysis using the one-way ANOVA test. Significant disparities were observed among the examined groups, particularly concerning the cerebral activity observed during the execution of the movement, both with and without the involvement of the serious game. Nevertheless, it was noted that for the majority of children diagnosed with cerebral palsy, no substantial distinctions were detected in the data collected during the moment of motor planning. The outcomes of our investigation have the potential to contribute to a more comprehensive comprehension of the motor cortex activity patterns exhibited by young individuals diagnosed with hemiparetic cerebral palsy while engaging in a motor task combined with a cognitive task within the context of serious game application. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Electroencephalography; Hemiparetic Cerebral Palsy; Serious Games; Voluntary Movement,

Although many protocols use videogames in children with CP, few apply or examine motor learning principles. This study aims at (1) implementing therapist–user–designer collaboration in adapting a videogame to the principles of motor learning and the characteristics of users with CP, and (2) piloting the effectiveness of these adaptations by analyzing the achievement of motor learning parameters (learning rate acquisition, retention, and transfer to motor and somatosensory function). Materials and Methods: Periodical interprofessional meetings conducted to the adaptation of a videogame, requiring the control of a joystick for traveling through a maze, to motor learning principles. In a pilot validation, effects in unilateral upper limb function, gross manual dexterity, and somatosensory thresholds were assessed before and after 10-week training in 13 children with CP. Results: After 10-week training with the adapted serious game, children showed learning rates above 90% and improvement in motor learning parameters along the sessions. Manual dexterity and pronation–supination of the dominant hand improved after training. No significant effects were found on somatosensory thresholds. Conclusion: Serious games are useful as motor learning tools for improving motor function in children with PC. Cooperative work among professionals and users is advisable for designing efficient videogames according to rehabilitation best practices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cerebral Palsy; Motor Learning; Motor Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Human; Learning; Motor Performance; Upper Limb; Video Game; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Humans; Learning; Motor Skills; Upper Extremity; Video Games,cerebral palsy; child; human; learning; motor performance; upper limb; video game; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Humans; Learning; Motor Skills; Upper Extremity; Video Games

Articles published from 2010 to 2022 focusing on serious game-based rehabilitation for people with CP are extracted from MEDILINE, Academic Search Ultimate, CINAHL, and the Web of Science. The articles were assessed based on the McMaster critical review form. This study analyzes the frequencies of goal and assessment tools according to the components using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). The evidence of all the studies is presented according to the principles of Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) to organize the evidence. A total of 19 articles were selected. Five articles involved Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), six articles involved non-randomized one-group designs, three articles involved single experimental study designs, and five articles were case report designs. In the selected articles, the average score on the McMaster critical review form was 11.8 points. In the game-based rehabilitation for CP, more articles reported goals and assessment tools focusing on body function than goals and assessment tools focusing on activity and participation, according to the ICF.

However, most individuals are unable to sustain regular and repetitive exercise sessions due to the boredom of hospital facilities and the long distance between home and hospital. In order to attract children, our team designed an interactive portable ball associated with Unity-based computer games so that children can exercise at home without the help of physiatrists. To encourage children to actively participate in rehabilitation training, two computer games are designed with visual and auditory feedback, including a three-dimensional (3D) plane flight simulation and a two-dimensional (2D) shape drawing. The upper limb exercise data could be recorded through a machine vision-based evaluation system to allow for analysis of the rehabilitation process and hence evaluation. Preliminary tests have been performed on children with CP. Feedback shows that this device can enhance the exercise of children's fingers, wrists, and shoulder muscles, as well as improve cognitive ability in shape recognition. The design is highly flexible, allowing for customization dependent on the severity of the disease. Also, more rehabilitation games can be developed by adjusting game difficulty levels to meet specific needs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Assistive Training For Cerebral Palsy Patients; Training Games; Upper Limb Rehabilitation Device; Diseases; Feedback; Flight Simulators; Hospitals; Patient Rehabilitation; Virtual Reality; Assistive; Assistive Training For Cerebral Palsy Patient; Cerebral Palsy; Children With Cerebral Palsies; Motor Control; Rehabilitation Devices; Training Game; Upper Limb Rehabilitation Device; Upper-extremity; Upper-limb Rehabilitation; Computer Games,Diseases; Feedback; Flight simulators; Hospitals; Patient rehabilitation; Virtual reality; Assistive; Assistive training for cerebral palsy patient; Cerebral palsy; Children with cerebral palsies; Motor control; Rehabilitation devices; Training game; Upper limb rehabilitation device; Upper-extremity; Upper-limb rehabilitation; Computer games

VMA-oriented frameworks can have clinical applications, primarily in the investigation and assessment of neuromotor impairments caused by conditions such as Parkinson’s disease or post-stroke, which affect the lives of tens of thousands of people worldwide. Therefore, they can enhance the understanding of the specific mechanisms of such neuromotor disorders, thus being a potential biomarker for recovery, with the aim of being integrated with conventional rehabilitative programs. Virtual Reality (VR) can be entailed in a framework targeting VMA since it allows the development of visual perturbations in a more customizable and realistic way. Moreover, as has been demonstrated in previous works, a serious game (SG) can further increase engagement thanks to the use of full-body embodied avatars. Most studies implementing VMA frameworks have focused on upper limb tasks and have utilized a cursor as visual feedback for the user. Hence, there is a paucity in the literature about VMA-oriented frameworks targeting locomotion tasks. In this article, the authors present the design, development, and testing of an SG-based framework that addresses VMA in a locomotion activity by controlling a full-body moving avatar in a custom VR environment. This workflow includes a set of metrics to quantitatively assess the participants’ performance. Thirteen healthy children were recruited to evaluate the framework. Several quantitative comparisons and analyses were run to validate the different types of introduced visuomotor perturbations and to evaluate the ability of the proposed metrics to describe the difficulty caused by such perturbations. During the experimental sessions, it emerged that the system is safe, easy to use, and practical in a clinical setting. Despite the limited sample size, which represents the main limitation of the study and can be compensated for with future recruitment, the authors claim the potential of this framework as a useful instrument for quantitatively assessing either motor or cognitive impairments. The proposed feature-based approach gives several objective parameters as additional biomarkers that can integrate the conventional clinical scores. Future studies might investigate the relation between the proposed biomarkers and the clinical scores for specific disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and cerebral palsy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Avatar; Azure Kinect; Body Tracking; Gait; Human Skeleton; Motion Capture; Serious Game; Virtual Reality; Visual Feedback; Visuomotor Adaptation; Biomarkers; Feedback; Serious Games; Visual Communication; Avatar; Azure Kinect; Body Tracking; Gait; Human Skeleton; Motion Capture; Neuromotor; Visual Feedback; Visuomotor Adaptation; Visuomotors; Virtual Reality; Cerebrovascular Accident; Child; Human; Locomotion; Parkinson Disease; Virtual Reality; Child; Humans; Locomotion; Parkinson Disease; Stroke; User-computer Interface; Virtual Reality,Biomarkers; Feedback; Serious games; Visual communication; Avatar; Azure kinect; Body tracking; Gait; Human skeleton; Motion capture; Neuromotor; Visual feedback; Visuomotor adaptation; Visuomotors; Virtual reality; cerebrovascular accident; child; human; locomotion; Parkinson disease; virtual reality; Child; Humans; Locomotion; Parkinson Disease; Stroke; User-Computer Interface; Virtual Reality

One of the important methods in helping to carry out efficient rehabilitation processes and exercises is the use of games. The aim of this study is to identify the parameters necessary to design a successful rehabilitation game and the outcomes of using these games in upper limb disabilities rehabilitation. Methods: This scoping review was conducted by searching the Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus. The eligibility criteria were: any form of game-based upper limb rehabilitation, published in a peer-reviewed journal, published in English, and not include articles that did not focus upper limb disabilities rehabilitation games, review, meta-analysis, or conference papers. Analysis of collected data was done using descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage). Results: The search strategy retrieved 537 relevant articles. Finally, after removing irrelevant and repetitive articles, 21 articles were included in this study. Among the six categories of diseases or complications of upper limb disabilities, games were mostly designed for stroke patients. Smart wearables, robots and telerehabilitation were three technologies that were used for rehabilitation along with games. Sports and shooters were the most used games for upper limb disability rehabilitation. Among 99 necessary parameters for designing and implementing a successful rehabilitation game in ten categories. “Increasing the patient's motivation to perform rehabilitation exercises”, “Game difficulty levels”, “Enjoying and the attractiveness of the game for patients”, and “Providing positive or negative audiovisual feedback” were the most important parameters. “Improvement in musculoskeletal performance” and “Increasing users' enjoyment/joy of therapeutic exercises and their motivation to perform these exercises” were the most important positive outcomes, and “Mild discomfort such as nausea and dizziness when using games” was the only negative outcome. Conclusions: The successful design of a game according to the parameters identified in the present study can lead to an increase in the positive outcomes of using games in the rehabilitation of disabilities. The study results indicate that upper limb therapeutic exercise augmented with virtual reality games may be highly effective in enhancing motor rehabilitation outcomes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Game; Rehabilitation; Upper Limb; Virtual Reality (vr); Cerebral Palsy; Cerebrovascular Accident; Clinical Outcome; Daily Life Activity; Disability; Dizziness; Eligibility Criteria; Exercise; Exercise Intensity; Game; Human; Medline; Motivation; Nausea; Outcome Assessment; Preferred Reporting Items For Systematic Reviews And Meta-analyses; Review; Robotics; Scopus; Shoulder Impingement Syndrome; Statistics; Stretching Exercise; Stroke Patient; Telerehabilitation; Upper Limb; Virtual Reality; Web Of Science,cerebral palsy; cerebrovascular accident; clinical outcome; daily life activity; disability; dizziness; eligibility criteria; exercise; exercise intensity; game; human; Medline; motivation; nausea; outcome assessment; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; Review; robotics; Scopus; shoulder impingement syndrome; statistics; stretching exercise; stroke patient; telerehabilitation; upper limb; virtual reality; Web of Science

Still, most of the proposed virtual settings provide a high quality, immersive visual and audio feedback, without involving the sense of touch. In this paper, we show the design, implementation, and first evaluation of a gaming scenario for upper limb rehabilitation of children with cerebral palsy. In particular, we took care to introduce haptic feedback as a useful source of sensory information for the proposed task, considering—at the same time—the strict constraints for haptic wearable devices to comply with patient’s comfort, residual motor abilities, and with the embedded tracking features of the latest VR technologies. To show the potential of haptics in a rehabilitation setup, the proposed device and rendering method have been used to improve the velocity control of upper limb movements during the VR exercise, given its importance as a motor recovery metric. Eight healthy participants were enrolled, and results showed that haptic feedback can lead to lower speed tracking errors and higher movement smoothness, making the proposed setup suitable to be used in a rehabilitation context as a way to promote movement fluidity during exercises. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cerebral Palsy; Haptic; Haptics; Immersive; Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Virtual; Wearable,

We have developed BrainTagger, a suite of serious games that evaluate and potentially train cognitive abilities such as inhibitory control, processing speed, cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Ideally, cognitive assessments can be used as sentinels to detect problems that might damage brain functions (e.g., dehydration, poor nutrition, depression, delirium, inappropriate medication). In this paper, we report on a multi-year effort to develop hardware and software solutions that support effective implementation of cognitive assessment games (CAGs) in long-term care. Issues and constraints addressed include accommodating physical disabilities; making cognitive assessment enjoyable and engaging; providing scientific evidence that each game is measuring the intended construct; and reporting game results in a meaningful way. This article describes how we addressed some of these issues and demonstrates the sustained effort required to make this type of functionality work in practice. We also include some preliminary design guidelines, based on our experience, that may be useful in guiding future work on developing CAGs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cognitive Assessment; Design; Gamification; Long-term Care; Older Adults; Damage Detection; Cognitive Ability; Cognitive Assessments; Cognitive Decline; Cognitive Flexibility; Cognitive Training; Control Processing; Gamification; Long Term Care; Older Adults; Processing Speed; Serious Games,Damage detection; Cognitive ability; Cognitive assessments; Cognitive decline; Cognitive flexibility; Cognitive training; Control processing; Gamification; Long term care; Older adults; Processing speed; Serious games

This paper presents Rehabotics, an innovative rehabilitation platform incorporating a multi-component design for the rehabilitation of patients with post-stroke spasticity in the upper limbs. This system incorporates a sensor-equipped soft glove, a robotic exoskeleton hand, and an augmented reality (AR) platform with serious games of varying difficulties for adaptive therapy personalization. The soft glove collects data regarding hand movements and force exertion levels when the patient touches an object. In conjunction with a web camera, this enables real-time physical therapy using AR serious games, thus targeting specific motor skills. The exoskeleton hand, facilitated by servomotors, assists patients in hand movements, specifically aiding in overcoming the challenge of hand opening. The proposed system utilizes the data collected and (in combination with the clinical measurements) provides personalized and refined rehabilitation plans and targeted therapy to the affected hand. A pilot study of Rehabotics was conducted with a sample of 14 stroke patients.

This research presents comprehension and cultivates learning interest by developing an educational first-aid game in the Indonesian language, utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and the A* algorithm. The selection of the A* algorithm is based on its efficiency in optimizing pathfinding through a heuristic-based approach. By employing heuristics, the number of nodes requiring evaluation can be significantly reduced, enabling Non-Playable Characters (NPC) or the ambulance character to swiftly and effectively determine the best routes for providing aid. This efficiency is particularly critical in illustrating the context of first aid, where every second has a profound impact on safety and health. The functionality of the game operates effectively, demonstrated by the successful independent A* path testing. Additionally, the results from beta testing indicate a user satisfaction level of 92%, affirming the value of this game as a viable option for children or students unable to engage in extracurricular first aid activities at school.

One of the main disturbances in EE is in the coordination of the upper extremities and hands. Traditional rehabilitation for this type of pathology focuses on the alleviation of gross or fine motor disability. In the last few years, the use of low-cost devices together with customized serious games has shown improvements in motor disorders and enrichments in activities of daily living. Objective: This study aims to explore the feasibility of a new serious game for improving fine motor control in children with EE. Methods: The participants were 4 children with EE (male: n=2, 50%; female: n=2, 50%) who were classified as belonging to level 1 in the Gross Motor Classification System. The children were tested over 10 sessions during the intervention period (before and after treatment). The clinical tests performed were the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, 2nd edition and Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale. The subscales of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, 2nd edition were fine motor precision, fine motor integration, manual dexterity, and upper-limb coordination. At the end of the first session, we used the User Satisfaction Evaluation Questionnaire to analyze user satisfaction. Results: The significance outcomes for a Student t test (1-tailed) were as follows: P=.009 for fine motor precision, P=.002 for fine motor integration, P=.56 for manual dexterity, and P=.99 for upper-limb coordination. The participation rate as measured using the Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale was between good and very good, which means that, based on the therapist’s evaluation, interest, independence, and motivation were achieved by each participant. The mean User Satisfaction Evaluation Questionnaire score was close to 30, which is the maximum value. Conclusions: The results support the use of the proposed serious game as a complement in therapeutic sessions during the rehabilitation processes for children with EE. Significant improvements in fine motor control and activities of daily living revealed that the proposed serious game is beneficial for fine motor disorders of this pathology. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Children With Epileptic Encephalopathy; Ecologic Virtual System; Fine Motor Rehabilitation; Rare Diseases; Serious Game; Virtual Motor Rehabilitation; Virtual Reality,

Conventional physical rehabilitation relies on professional trainers, equipment, and facilities, which are time-consuming and expensive for users. It often reduces the users' motivation to perform exercises. It can be difficult for users to continue their physical rehabilitation through the conventional model. However, recent studies demonstrate that serious games have the potential to improve the effectiveness of rehabilitation training through a more engaged and immersive game design. Most of those studies focus on technology and the development of a specific MoCap sensor-based SG design for users with motor deficiencies, rather than emphasizing the users' experience impacting the effect of performance in physical rehabilitation. This study developed a prototype of a physical rehabilitation exercise game that considers user experience. This game employs a wearable inertial MoCap sensor enabling users to interact intuitively with the game to promote physical activities for health. We analyze and discuss user satisfaction and game experience through user experience questionnaires. The results suggest that most users were satisfied with the SG-based rehabilitation, and found the game was enjoyable and engaging. Based on the implications, we discuss possible future research to improve user experience of the highly accurate real-time MoCap-based serious game. This can enable users with motor disabilities to undertake physical exercises in a home environment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Motion Capture; Physical Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Usability; User Experience; Game Design; Patient Rehabilitation; Wearable Sensors; Biomedical Monitoring; Entertainment Industry; Game; Motion Capture; Physical Rehabilitation; Tracking; Usability; Users' Experiences; Serious Games,Game design; Patient rehabilitation; Wearable sensors; Biomedical monitoring; Entertainment industry; Game; Motion capture; Physical rehabilitation; Tracking; Usability; Users' experiences; Serious games

However, existing methods for assessing patients' motor function rely on clinical scales that require experienced physicians to guide patients through target tasks during the assessment process. This process is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive, but the complex assessment process is also uncomfortable for patients and has significant limitations. For this reason, we propose a serious game that automatically assesses the degree of upper limb motor impairment in stroke patients. Specifically, we divide this serious game into a preparation stage and a competition stage. In each stage, we construct motor features based on clinical a priori knowledge to reflect the ability indicators of the patient's upper limbs. These features all correlated significantly with the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), which assesses motor impairment in stroke patients. In addition, we design membership functions and fuzzy rules for motor features in combination with the opinions of rehabilitation therapists to construct a hierarchical fuzzy inference system to assess the motor function of upper limbs in stroke patients. In this study, we recruited a total of 24 patients with varying degrees of stroke and 8 healthy controls to participate in the Serious Game System test.

It allows for parameter adjustment and the monitoring of results remotely, thereby providing a useful tool to complement traditional physical therapy sessions with home exercises. Objective: The aim of this study was to observe the motor benefits achieved through the use of a video exergame and the importance and implications of correctly setting the game’s difficulty parameters. Methods: This was an observational case study of 6 children with different physical disabilities receiving physical therapy at school combined with the use of a fully configurable exergame under research that forms a part of the Blexer environment. The game integrates 4 repeatedly appearing upper limb exercises with individually adjustable difficulties (intermittent arm rising, arm forward and backward movement, rising and holding of one arm, and trunk control in all directions). The outcomes were 3 assessments of 2 efficacy measures: Box and Block Test and Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test. Results: A total of 5 children with cerebral palsy (mean 8.4, SD 2.7 years; Gross Motor Function Classification II—2/5, 40%; III—2/5, 40%; and IV—1/5, 20%) and 1 child with obstetric brachial plexus palsy (aged 8 years; Mallet Classification III) received between 8 and 11 sessions of training (10-20 minutes per session), depending on age, motivation, and fatigue. Significant associations were observed between game parameter settings and improvements in motor function, on the one hand, and between the type of improvement and disability severity, on the other: with adjusted game parameters goal and time in the range of 70% to 100%, only less affected children improved in the Box and Block Test (+11 blocks vs −1 block), and more affected children improved more in the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test (+90 seconds vs +27 seconds). Conclusions: When defining the difficulty parameters for an exergame, we suggest a classification in levels ranging from very easy to very hard. For practical use, we suggest setting the difficulty for the player to an easy or medium level rather than high-commitment goals, as this leads to a longer playtime with more fun and, therefore, seems to improve the results of the game and, consequently, mobility. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cerebral Palsy; Exergames; Kinect; Obstetric Brachial Plexus Palsy; Physical Therapy; Rehabilitation; Serious Games,

This paper aims to describe the process and considerations in developing and designing a VR application for children with CP, and in assessing the proposed VR application. Toward these objectives, requirements for the application were determined through an iterative process of review of literature, focus group discussions among rehabilitation professionals and game designers, and prototype-testing. Participants agreed on the importance of interprofessional collaboration and designing role-play games to improve adherence to therapeutic plans. Results highlight the need for an application that is (a) tailored to the needs of children with CP, but also flexible for customization to their varying presentations and levels of skill; (b) able to balance familiarity, fun, and challenge to encourage and engage patients to participate in therapy; and (c) available and accessible to health professionals and their patients. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cerebral Palsy; Immersive Technology; Virtual Reality; Vr Design Strategies,

Summarizing the features of the current AI-driven serious games is very important to explore how they have been developed and used and their current state to plan on how to leverage them in the current and future health care needs. Objective: This study aimed to explore the features of AI-driven serious games in health care as reported by previous research. Methods: We conducted a scoping review to achieve the abovementioned objective. The most popular databases in the information technology and health fields (ie, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Embase, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar) were searched using keywords related to serious games and AI. Two reviewers independently performed the study selection process. Three reviewers independently extracted data from the included studies. A narrative approach was used for data synthesis. Results: The search process returned 1470 records. Of these 1470 records, 46 (31.29%) met all eligibility criteria. A total of 64 different serious games were found in the included studies. Motor impairment was the most common health condition targeted by these serious games. Serious games were used for rehabilitation in most of the studies. The most common genres of serious games were role-playing games, puzzle games, and platform games. Unity was the most prominent game engine used to develop serious games. PCs were the most common platform used to play serious games. The most common algorithm used in the included studies was support vector machine. The most common purposes of AI were the detection of disease and the evaluation of user performance. The size of the data set ranged from 36 to 795,600. The most common validation techniques used in the included studies were k-fold cross-validation and training-test split validation. Accuracy was the most commonly used metric for evaluating the performance of AI models. Conclusions: The last decade witnessed an increase in the development of AI-driven serious games for health care purposes, targeting various health conditions, and leveraging multiple AI algorithms; this rising trend is expected to continue for years to come. Although the evidence uncovered in this study shows promising applications of AI-driven serious games, larger and more rigorous, diverse, and robust studies may be needed to examine the efficacy and effectiveness of AI-driven serious games in different populations with different health conditions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; Digital Health; Ehealth; Health Care; Machine Learning; Mobile Phone; Serious Games,

A unilateral stroke may severely impair bimanual ADL. How patients with stroke (re)learn to coordinate their upper limbs (ULs) is largely unknown. The objectives are to determine whether patients with chronic supratentorial stroke could achieve bimanual motor skill learning (bim-MSkL) and to compare bim-MSkL between patients and healthy individuals (HIs). Methods: Twenty-four patients and ten HIs trained over 3 consecutive days on an asymmetrical bimanual coordination task (CIRCUIT) implemented as a serious game in the REAplan® robot. With a common cursor controlled by coordinated movements of the ULs through robotic handles, they performed as many laps as possible (speed constraint) on the CIRCUIT while keeping the cursor within the track (accuracy constraint). The primary outcome was a bimanual speed/accuracy trade-off (biSAT), we used a bimanual coordination factor (biCO) and bimanual forces (biFOP) for the secondary outcomes. Several clinical scales were used to evaluate motor and cognitive functions. Results: Overall, the patients showed improvements on biSAT and biCO. Based on biSAT progression, the HI achieved a larger bim-MSkL than the patients with mild to moderate impairment (Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity (FMA-UE): 28–55, n = 15) but not significantly different from those with minimal motor impairment (FMA-UE: 66, n = 9). There was a significant positive correlation between biSAT evolution and the FMA-UE and Stroke Impact Scale. Conclusions: Both HI and patients with chronic stroke training on a robotic device achieved bim-MSkL, although the more impaired patients were less efficient. Bim-MSkL with REAplan® may be interesting for neurorehabilitation after stroke. Trial registration: ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT03974750.

This aims to provide a tool that can be individually tailored and adapted to people with different needs, making it applicable to different diseases and states of disease. The game is based on motion capturing and integrates four example exercises that can be configured via our therapeutic web platform “Blexer-med”. To prove the feasibility for a wide range of different users, evaluation tests were performed on 14 patients with various types and degrees of neuromuscular disorders, classified into three groups based on strength and autonomy. The users were free to choose their schedule and frequency. The game scores and three surveys (before, during, and after the intervention) showed similar experiences for all groups, with the most vulnerable having the most fun and satisfaction. The players were motivated by the story and by achieving high scores. The average usage time was 2.5 times per week, 20 min per session. The pure exercise time was about half of the game time. The concept has proven feasible and forms a reasonable basis for further developments. The full 3D exercise needs further fine-tuning to enhance the fun and motivation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Exergames; Kinect; Neuromuscular Disease; Physical Disability; Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Virtual Reality Rehabilitation (vrr),

A racing track was used as the game narrative; this included restriction areas, static and dynamic virtual objects, as well as obstacles and signs. To experience the game, a prior configuration of the environment, made through a smartphone or a computer, was required. Furthermore, a visualization tool was developed to exhibit user performance while using the ARSG. Two user studies were conducted with 10 and 20 participants, respectively, to compare (1) how different devices enable configuring the ARSG, and (2) different tracking capabilities, i.e., methods used to place virtual content on the real-world environment while the user interacts with the game and controls the wheelchair in the physical space: C1—motion tracking using cloud anchors; C2—offline motion tracking. Results suggest that configuring the environment with the computer is more efficient and accurate, in contrast to the smartphone, which is characterized as more engaging. In addition, condition C1 stood out as more accurate and robust, while condition C2 appeared to be easier to use. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Augmented Reality; Human-centered Design; Industry 4.0; Maintenance Authoring Tool; Remote Collaboration; User Study; Visual Characteristics; Augmented Reality; Industry 4.0; Motion Analysis; Smartphones; Wheelchairs; Authoring Tool; Condition; Games For Learning; Human-centred Designs; Maintenance Authoring Tool; Motion Tracking; Remote Collaboration; Smart Phones; User Study; Visual Characteristic; Serious Games; Computer Interface; Human; Learning; Smartphone; Wheelchair; Augmented Reality; Humans; Learning; Smartphone; User-computer Interface,Augmented reality; Industry 4.0; Motion analysis; Smartphones; Wheelchairs; Authoring tool; Condition; Games for learning; Human-centred designs; Maintenance authoring tool; Motion tracking; Remote collaboration; Smart phones; User study; Visual characteristic; Serious games; computer interface; human; learning; smartphone; wheelchair; Augmented Reality; Humans; Learning; Smartphone; User-Computer Interface

However, many people with chronic pain find functional activation programs aversive, and dropout rates are high. Modern technologies such as virtual reality (VR) could provide a more enjoyable and less threatening way for people with chronic pain to engage in physical activity. Although VR has been successfully used for pain relief in acute and chronic pain settings, as well as to facilitate rehabilitation in conditions such as stroke and cerebral palsy, it is not known whether VR can also be used to improve functional outcomes in people with chronic pain. Objective: This study aimed to assess the feasibility of conducting an adequately powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of VR in a chronic pain treatment center and assess the acceptability of an active VR treatment program for patients in this setting. Methods: For this mixed methods pilot study, which was designed to test the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed study methods, 29 people seeking treatment for chronic pain were randomized to an active VR intervention or physiotherapy treatment as usual (TAU). The TAU group completed a 6-week waitlist before receiving standard treatment to act as a no-treatment control group. The VR intervention comprised twice-weekly immersive and embodied VR sessions using commercially available gaming software, which was selected to encourage movement. A total of 7 VR participants completed semistructured interviews to assess their perception of the intervention. Results: Of the 99 patients referred to physiotherapy, 53 (54%) were eligible, 29 (29%) enrolled, and 17 (17%) completed the trial, indicating that running an adequately powered RCT in this setting would not be feasible. Despite this, those in the VR group showed greater improvements in activity levels, pain intensity, and pain interference and reported greater treatment satisfaction and perceived improvement than both the waitlist and TAU groups. Relative effect sizes were larger when VR was compared with the waitlist (range small to very large) and smaller when VR was compared with TAU (range none to medium). The qualitative analysis produced the following three themes: VR is an enjoyable alternative to traditional physiotherapy, VR has functional and psychological benefits despite continued pain, and a well-designed VR setup is important. Conclusions: The active VR intervention in this study was highly acceptable to participants, produced favorable effects when compared with the waitlist, and showed similar outcomes as those of TAU. These findings suggest that a confirmatory RCT is warranted; however, substantial barriers to recruitment indicate that incentivizing participation and using a different treatment setting or running a multicenter trial are needed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Acceptability; Chronic Pain; Feasibility; Intervention; Pain Management; Physiotherapy; Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Virtual Reality; Vr,

Methods: Twenty chronic stroke survivors (>6 months) with moderate hand impairment were randomized to train either unilaterally (paretic only) or bilaterally over 9 one-hour training sessions. EMG signals from the unilateral or bilateral limbs controlled a cursor location on a computer screen for gameplay. The EMG muscle activation vector was projected onto the plane defined by the first 2 principal components of the activation workspace for the nonparetic hand. These principal components formed the x- A nd y-axes of the computer screen. Results: The recruitment goal (n = 20) was met over 9 months, with no screen failure, no attrition, and 97.8% adherence rate. After training, both groups significantly decreased the time to move the cursor to a novel sequence of targets (P = 0.006) by reducing normalized path length of the cursor movement (P = 0.005), and improved the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) quality score (P = 0.01). No significant group difference was observed. No significant change was seen in the WMFT time or Box and Block Test. Discussion/Conclusions: Stroke survivors could successfully use the EMG-controlled games to train control of muscle activation patterns. While the nonparetic limb EMG was used in this study to create target EMG patterns, the system supports various means for creating target patterns per user desires. Future studies will employ training with the EMG-controlled games in conjunction with functional task practice for a longer intervention duration to improve overall hand function.

Among the existing automated rehabilitation approaches, data glove-based systems are not easy to wear for patients due to spasticity, and single sensor-based approaches generally provided prohibitively limited information. We thus propose a wearable multimodal serious games approach for hand movement training after stroke. A force myography (FMG), electromyography (EMG), and inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based multi-sensor fusion model was proposed for hand movement classification, which was worn on the user’s affected arm. Two movement recognition-based serious games were developed for hand movement and cognition training. Ten stroke patients with mild to moderate motor impairments (Brunnstrom Stage for Hand II-VI) performed experiments while playing interactive serious games requiring 12 activities-of-daily-living (ADLs) hand movements taken from the Fugl Meyer Assessment. Feasibility was evaluated by movement classification accuracy and qualitative patient questionnaires. The offline classification accuracy using combined FMG-EMG-IMU was 81.0% for the 12 movements, which was significantly higher than any single sensing modality; only EMG, only FMG, and only IMU were 69.6, 63.2, and 47.8%, respectively. Patients reported that they were more enthusiastic about hand movement training while playing the serious games as compared to conventional methods and strongly agreed that they subjectively felt that the proposed training could be beneficial for improving upper limb motor function. These results showed that multimodal-sensor fusion improved hand gesture classification accuracy for stroke patients and demonstrated the potential of this proposed approach to be used as upper limb movement training after stroke. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Emg; Fmg; Imu; Movement Training; Stroke; Adult; Arm Exercise; Article; Cerebrovascular Accident; Clinical Article; Cognition; Daily Life Activity; Electromyography; Feasibility Study; Female; Gesture; Hand Movement; Human; Male; Motor Dysfunction; Motor Performance; Questionnaire; Stroke Patient; Treatment Outcome; Upper Limb,adult; arm exercise; Article; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; cognition; daily life activity; electromyography; feasibility study; female; gesture; hand movement; human; male; motor dysfunction; motor performance; questionnaire; stroke patient; treatment outcome; upper limb

One technique that may prove effective in delaying the onset of CI in PD is cognitive training (CT); however, evidence to date is variable. This may be due to the implementation of CT in this population, with the motor impairments of PD potentially hampering the ability to use standard equipment, such as pen-and-paper or a computer mouse. This may, in turn, promote negative attitudes toward the CT paradigm, which may correlate with poorer outcomes. Consequently, optimizing a system for the delivery of CT in the PD population may improve the accessibility of and engagement with the CT paradigm, subsequently leading to better outcomes. To achieve this, the NeuroOrb Gaming System was designed, coupling a novel accessible controller, specifically developed for use with people with motor impairments, with a “Serious Games” software suite, custom-designed to target the cognitive domains typically affected in PD. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the usability of the NeuroOrb through a reiterative co-design process, in order to optimize the system for future use in clinical trials of CT in individuals with PD. Individuals with PD (n = 13; mean age = 68.15 years; mean disease duration = 8 years) were recruited from the community and participated in three co-design loops. After implementation of key stakeholder feedback to make significant modifications to the system, system usability was improved and participant attitudes toward the NeuroOrb were very positive. Taken together, this provides rationale for moving forward with a future clinical trial investigating the utility of the NeuroOrb as a tool to deliver CT in PD. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Brain Training; Co-design; Cognitive Impairment; Cognitive Training; Dementia; Parkinson’s; Serious Games; Neuroorb; Aged; Article; Clinical Article; Clinical Outcome; Cognitive Defect; Cognitive Rehabilitation; Controlled Study; Demographics; Disease Duration; Ergonomics; Feedback System; Female; Human; Male; Motor Dysfunction; Parkinson Disease; Patient Attitude; Patient Selection; Process Optimization; Product Design; Questionnaire; Stakeholder Engagement; Usability Testing,aged; Article; clinical article; clinical outcome; cognitive defect; cognitive rehabilitation; controlled study; demographics; disease duration; ergonomics; feedback system; female; human; male; motor dysfunction; Parkinson disease; patient attitude; patient selection; process optimization; product design; questionnaire; stakeholder engagement; usability testing

However, motor abnormalities are also common in ASD. New technologies may offer quantitative and automatic metrics to measure movement difficulties. We sought to identify computational methods to automatize the assessment of motor impairments in ASD. We systematically searched for the terms ’autism’, ’movement’, ’automatic’, ’computational’ and ’engineering’ in IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), Medline and Scopus databases and reviewed the literature from inception to 2018. We included all articles discussing: (1) automatic assessment/new technologies, (2) motor behaviours and (3) children with ASD. We excluded studies that included patient’s or parent’s reported outcomes as online questionnaires that focused on computational models of movement, but also eye tracking, facial emotion or sleep. In total, we found 53 relevant articles that explored static and kinetic equilibrium, like posture, walking, fine motor skills, motor synchrony and movements during social interaction that can be impaired in individuals with autism. Several devices were used to capture relevant motor information such as cameras, 3D cameras, motion capture systems, accelerometers. Interestingly, since 2012, the number of studies increased dramatically as technologies became less invasive, more precise and more affordable. Open-source software has enabled the extraction of relevant data. In a few cases, these technologies have been implemented in serious games, like “Pictogram Room”, to measure the motor status and the progress of children with ASD. Movement computing opens new perspectives for patient assessment in ASD research, enabling precise characterizations in experimental and at-home settings, and a better understanding of the role of sensorimotor disturbances in the development of social cognition and ASD. These methods would likely enable researchers and clinicians to better distinguish ASD from other motors disorders while facilitating an improved monitoring of children’s progress in more ecological settings (i.e. at home or school). © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Autism Spectrum Disorders; Automatic; Clumsiness; Computational; Diagnosis; Movement; Cameras; Computational Methods; Diseases; Eye Tracking; Open Systems; Serious Games; Surveys; Autism Spectrum Disorders; Automatic; Automatic Assessment; Children With Autisms; Clumsiness; Computational; Motor Impairments; Movement; Quantitative Metric; Systematic Review; Open Source Software,Cameras; Computational methods; Diseases; Eye tracking; Open systems; Serious games; Surveys; Autism spectrum disorders; Automatic; Automatic assessment; Children with autisms; Clumsiness; Computational; Motor impairments; Movement; Quantitative metric; Systematic Review; Open source software

In the present work, we have implemented a Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach to target this problem, right at the stage of training new game designers and game developers. Thus, through a game-design-based or experimental game design pedagogical approach, we intended to promote inclusive and accessibility-driven game design and development skills in students, while decreasing their negative attitudes towards people with Intellectual Disability (pwID). A protocol with a Non-Governmental Organization in the field was established and, during two semesters, students were challenged to develop 10 accessible games and physical interfaces for pwID and motor disabilities, through participatory processes. Pre and post assessment was conducted, through a mixed-method approach. After participating in this process, students reported satisfaction and increased knowledge of cognitive and motor accessibility, and inclusive game design in general. Moreover, the attitudinal assessment showed significantly lower levels of prejudiced beliefs towards pwID (p < 0.05). © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Accessibility; Game Creation; Game Design; Game Development; Game-based Learning; Games; Higher Education; Inclusion; Intellectual Disability,

One of them is the effective combination of game design and development aspects with the therapeutic activities aimed at prevention, diagnosis, and motor rehabilitation. Aiming to help people with sensory-motor disabilities to acquire, recover or maintain their range of motion, wearable devices with sensors can be incorporated into the design to estimate and measure kinematic and dynamic parameters. The use of wearable technologies brings potential benefits in supporting therapeutic exercises but also increases the challenge, as it will require finding a proper balance between the particularities of the sensors, the game design, and the protocols established by health professionals. Many parameters associated with muscle biosignals, such as speed, joint angles, body gravity center, reaction forces, tremor, and overall progress of patients, can be obtained using wearable devices. However, their use combined with serious games for sensory-motor rehabilitation requires proper mapping of the signals acquired through the sensors into useful metrics to support therapists in treatment planning and monitoring the patient's evolution, and how both will be linked into the game design.

Since the disease strongly influences the quality of life of patients, optimal solutions for the treatment of post-stroke patients are needed. The use of new technologies in the field of rehabilitation aims to reduce the impact of functional problems. Recent studies have shown that technologies such as virtual reality and video games can provide a way that can motivate and help patients recover their motor skills. In this paper, our objective is to evaluate the usability of the Leap Motion Controller virtual reality system (LMC), which is a sensor that captures the movement of the patient's hands and fingers without the need to place sensors or devices on the body, with serious games specifically designed for upper limbs rehabilitation in post-stroke patients. We measured the usability of the LMC system used with serious games as well as the level of satisfaction among healthy participants and post-stroke patients from Bounaama Djilali Hospital (CHU Douera) in Algeria. The results show favorable data, for the first time, the LMC is a usable tool, measured by the System Usability Scale (SUS). In addition, participants demonstrated good motivation, enjoyment and the majority of them said that they would like to use the proposed system in future treatment.

A further aim was to investigate the suitability of using video games or virtual reality as motivational technologies for gamified functional exercises. Methods: An upper limb exoskeleton and two gamified solutions adapted for functional exercises have been developed. Preliminary tests have been carried out with children with motor impairments and similar disorders to assess the level of satisfaction with the use of this proposed configuration. Results: The satisfaction results regarding the usability of the exoskeleton with these immersive gamified systems have been very positive, highlighting the ease of use, adaptability, comfort, lightness and safety of the exoskeleton. Preliminary validation results of the concept idea have also been excellent, as the exoskeleton system combined with the goal-directed tasks based video game has provided the user with the perception of control from the first session. The design, based on 3D printed materials, will allow the exoskeleton to be used more widely in day care centres due to its low cost and high usability. Conclusion: Training with gamified systems that motivate the patient to perform exercises together with exoskeletons that aid movement are positively accepted by children with motor disabilities. In addition, the use of an exoskeleton seems to improve the goals achieved by the children in the games. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Exoskeleton; Motor Disabilities; Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Upper Limb; 3d Printers; Exoskeleton (robotics); Human Computer Interaction; Neuromuscular Rehabilitation; Virtual Reality; Design And Evaluations; Ease-of-use; Exoskeleton; Goal-directed; Immersive; Level Of Satisfaction; Motor Disability; Motor Impairments; Upper Limbs; Video-games; Serious Games,3D printers; Exoskeleton (Robotics); Human computer interaction; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Virtual reality; Design and evaluations; Ease-of-use; Exoskeleton; Goal-directed; Immersive; Level of satisfaction; Motor disability; Motor impairments; Upper limbs; Video-games; Serious games

Their daily habits are undoubtedly influenced by technology and the applications they use can affect socialization and learning processes [2]. Specifically, games are the most popular type of applications and have the potential to change attitudes and behaviours. Emphasizing the importance of this area, we decided to create a serious game that stimulates the children’ responsibility for taking care of pets while they play, called “My Buddy”. In this paper, we present the development and assessment process of a 3D serious game, where the user is asked to interact with a pet and nurture it. The interface was developed based on the universal design philosophy, presenting itself attractive to children without disabilities, but also accessible to children with visual or motor disabilities. As such, we present a multimodal interface based on touch and speech commands. The game was tested in terms of usability, with a heuristic evaluation, and the results obtained highlight the potential of such interfaces. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",3d Technology; Children Education; Computer Graphics; Human-computer Interface; Serious Game; Speech Interaction Modality; Universal Design,

The modern immunomodulatory therapy has a satisfactory effect on the relapse rate and disease progression, but does not improve the degree of cognitive impairment. Over the last decade, the number of studies on treatment and management of cognitive impairment in people with MS are rapidly growing. A generalized net model for registration, assessment and rehabilitation of cognitive impairment in persons with MS has been developed. The assessment of cognitive status was made on the basis of results obtained through computer-based neuropsychological tests. Based on comparison of the results from MS patients with those of healthy controls, the degree of cognitive deficit was determined. The input of the generalized net was formed by the data from patient’s medical records, which were categorized according to disease duration, grade of disability, age, sex and employment. As a result of applying the InterCriteria Analysis, the output of the model provides information about the type of impaired cognitive domains and the degree of cognitive deterioration. This allows the therapist to build an appropriate rehabilitation strategy for each individual patient. The rehabilitation module contains a set of different rehabilitation games with several levels of difficulty. The frequency, as well as the degree of complexity of cognitive training is based on the patient’s results and the general cognitive reserve registered at baseline. The system is implemented in a cloud infrastructure and is planned to be provided as an IT service for neurological departments and clinics. In this way, the system is available for testing and rehabilitation of unlimited number of people (both healthy controls and persons with MS) at any time. The developed GN model provides a mechanism for description and simulation of these parallel processes. In this way, the proposed model will be useful in determining the individual approach to each patient and will help optimizing the results of cognitive rehabilitation. The analysis of the model will allow outlining the future directions for therapeutic approaches on cognitive impairments in MS, which will lead to inclusion of cognitive rehabilitation and training programs in routine clinical practice within the next decade. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cognitive Impairment; Cognitive Rehabilitation; Computer Training; Generalized Nets; Intercriteria Analysis; Multiple Sclerosis,

Serious games are games whose purpose lies beyond entertainment, and they can be applied in a multitude of activities within the health field, including rehabilitation. This work’s goal is show the results from the development of a serious game prototype. The game was designed to aid in both the motor rehabilitation and the psychoemotional aspects of patients with thoracolumbosacral spinal cord injury, wheelchair users, through a decision-making model that balance difficulty from user performance. The development process was structured in three stages: the first was the elaboration of project step diagram; the second consisted of the game’s design; and the third consisted of defining the prototype tests. The prototype contains the basic elements of a game, with definition of the scenario and aesthetics, technology, narrative, and definition of the decision-making model, in addition to having a multidisciplinary team to define the priority points for approaching the game, attending to the target audience needs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Wheelchair Users,

First, we engaged nine young people with Cerebral Palsy (CP) as design partners to co-create the biofeedback implementation. A commercially available, tap-controlled game was converted into a gesture-controlled game with added biofeedback. The game is controlled by forearm electromyography and inertial sensors. Changes required to integrate biofeedback are described in detail and highlight the importance of closely linking movement quality to short- and long-term game rewards. After development, 19 participants (8–17 years old) with CP played the game at home for 4 weeks. Participants played 17 ± 9 min/day, 4 ± 1 day/week. The biofeedback implementation proved efficient (i.e. participants reduced compensatory arm movements by 10.2 ± 4.0%), effective (i.e. participants made higher quality gestures over time), and engaging (i.e. participants consistently chose to review biofeedback). Participants found the game usable and enjoyable. Biofeedback design in therapy games should consider principles of motor learning, best practices in video game design, and user perspectives. Design recommendations for integrating biofeedback into therapy games are compiled in an infographic to support interdisciplinary knowledge sharing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assessment; Biofeedback; Developmental Disability; Knowledge Translation; Neurorehabilitation And Brain Computer Interfaces; Pediatrics; Recreation; Usability; Biofeedback; Cerebral Palsy; Design And Evaluations; Design Recommendations; Evidence-based; Inertial Sensor; Knowledge-sharing; Research Questions; User Perspectives; Human Computer Interaction; Adolescent; Biofeedback; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Electromyography; Human; Upper Limb; Video Game; Adolescent; Biofeedback, Psychology; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Electromyography; Humans; Upper Extremity; Video Games","Biofeedback; Cerebral palsy; Design and evaluations; Design recommendations; Evidence-based; Inertial sensor; Knowledge-sharing; Research questions; User perspectives; Human computer interaction; adolescent; biofeedback; cerebral palsy; child; electromyography; human; upper limb; video game; Adolescent; Biofeedback, Psychology; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Electromyography; Humans; Upper Extremity; Video Games"

A scoping review,2021,BMC Pediatrics,10.1186/s12887-021-02916-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118748093&doi=10.1186%2Fs12887-021-02916-5&partnerID=40&md5=504c559990381a4e9c23956863e61c9b,"Background: Motor deficiencies are observed in a large number of children with ADHD. Especially fine motor impairments can lead to academic underachievement, low self-esteem and frustration in affected children. Despite these far-reaching consequences, fine motor deficiencies have remained widely undertreated in the ADHD population. The aim of this review was to systematically map the evidence on existing training programs for remediating fine motor impairments in children with ADHD and to assess their effectiveness. Methods: The scoping review followed the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. In March 2020, PsycINFO, MEDLINE (PubMed), Web of Science, Google Scholar and The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for evidence. The eligibility criteria and the data charting process followed the PICO framework, complemented by study design. The investigated population included children with a formal ADHD diagnosis (either subtype) or elevated ADHD symptoms aged between 4 and 12 years, both on and off medication. All training interventions aiming at improving fine motor skills, having a fine motor component or fine motor improvements as a secondary outcome were assessed for eligibility; no comparators were specified. Results: Twelve articles were included in the final report, comprising observational and experimental studies as well as a review. Both offline and online or virtual training interventions were reported, often accompanied by physical activity and supplemented by training sessions at home. The training programs varied in length and intensity, but generally comprised several weeks and single or multiple training sessions per week. All interventions including more than one session were effective in the treatment of fine motor deficiencies in children with ADHD and had a wide range of additional positive outcomes. The effects could be maintained at follow-up. Conclusions: Fine motor training in children with ADHD can be very effective and multiple approaches including specific fine motor and cognitive training components, some kind of physical activity, feedback mechanisms, or multimodal treatments can be successful. Training programs need to be tailored to the specific characteristics of the ADHD population. A mHealth approach using serious games could be promising in this context due to its strong motivational components. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adhd; Children; Fine Motor Skills; Graphomotor Skills; Handwriting; Intervention; Mhealth; Training; Article; Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; Clinical Outcome; Evidence Based Practice; Handwriting; Human; Motor Dysfunction; Motor Performance; Physical Activity; Training; Attention Deficit Disorder; Child; Educational Status; Methodology; Preschool Child; Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity; Child; Child, Preschool; Educational Status; Humans; Research Design","Article; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; clinical outcome; evidence based practice; handwriting; human; motor dysfunction; motor performance; physical activity; training; attention deficit disorder; child; educational status; methodology; preschool child; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Child; Child, Preschool; Educational Status; Humans; Research Design"

This process demands several hours with a specialized therapist. Given resources and personnel shortages, the literature reports a high interest in robotic assisted rehabilitation solutions. Recently, cable-driven robotic architectures are attracting significant research interest for post-stroke rehabilitation. However, the existing cable-driven robots are mostly unilateral devices allowing the rehabilitation only of the most affected limb. This leaves unaddressed the rehabilitation of bimanual activities, which are predominant within the common Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Thus, this paper presents a specific novel design to achieve bimanual rehabilitation tasks that has been named as BiCAR robot. Specifically, this paper provides a full insight on the BiCAR system as well as on its dedicated developed software BiEval. In particular, BiEval software has been developed as based on a serious game strategy and a virtual reality environment to track the patient exercising duration, motion ranges, speeds, and forces over time for achieving a quantitative assessment of the rehabilitation progress. Finally, the paper presents the BiCAR/BiEval capabilities by referring to a pilot Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). The clinical trials have been used to validate the BiCAR/BiEval in terms of engineering feasibility and user acceptance to achieve an innovative cost-oriented integrated hardware/software device for the bimanual assistive rehabilitation of post-stroke patients. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Bimanual; Cable-driven Robots; Low Cost; Progress Tracking; Serious Games; Stroke Rehabilitation; Cables; Cost Engineering; Machine Design; Neuromuscular Rehabilitation; Robotics; Robots; Serious Games; Virtual Reality; Bimanual; Cable Driven Robots; Cable-driven; Low-costs; Motor Impairments; Post Stroke Patients; Progress Tracking; Research Interests; Robotics Architecture; Stroke Rehabilitation; Costs,Cables; Cost engineering; Machine design; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Robotics; Robots; Serious games; Virtual reality; Bimanual; Cable driven robots; Cable-driven; Low-costs; Motor impairments; Post stroke patients; Progress tracking; Research interests; Robotics architecture; Stroke rehabilitation; Costs

Currently, the only pharmacological treatments available for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in PD provide variable benefit, making the search for potential non-pharmacological therapies to improve cognitive function of significant interest. One such therapeutic strategy may be cognitive training (CT), which involves the repetition of standardized tasks with the aim of improving specific aspects of cognition. Several studies have examined the effects of CT in individuals with PD and have shown benefits in a variety of cognitive domains, but the widespread use of CT in these individuals may be limited by motor impairments and other concerns in study design. Here, we discuss the current state of the literature on the use of CT for PD and propose recommendations for future implementation. We also explore the potential use of more recent integrative, adaptive and assistive technologies, such as virtual reality, which may optimize the delivery of CT in PD. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Dementia; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Multimodal; Neurorehabilitaiton; Non-pharmaceutical; Prevent; Serious Game; Cognitive Defect; Cognitive Training; Game; Human; Mental Performance; Neurorehabilitation; Parkinson Disease; Review; Task Performance; Virtual Reality,cognitive defect; cognitive training; game; human; mental performance; neurorehabilitation; Parkinson disease; Review; task performance; virtual reality

However, many of these serious games are not adapted to the patient’s needs because they are not developed with a software engineering framework with a set of activities, actions, and tasks that must be executed when creating a software product. Better serious games for rehabilitation will be developed if the patient and therapist requirements are identified, the development is planned, and system improvements and feedback are involved. The goal is that the serious game must offer a more attractive environment, while maintaining patient interest in the rehabilitation process. Objective: This paper submits the results of a systematic review of serious games in physical rehabilitation identifying the benefits of using a software engineering framework. Methods: A systematic research was conducted using PubMed, PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database), IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, ACM Digital Library, Mary Ann Liebert, Taylor & Francis Online, Wiley Online Library, and Springer databases. The initial search resulted in 701 papers. After assessing the results according to the inclusion criteria, 83 papers were selected for this study. Results: From the 83 papers reviewed, 8 used a software engineering framework for its development. Most of them focused their efforts on 1 or more aspects, such as data acquisition and processing, game levels, motivation, therapist supervision. Conclusions: This systematic review proves that most of the serious games do not use a software engineering framework for their development. As a result, development systems overlook several aspects and do not have a standardized process, eventually omitting important implementation aspects, which impact the patient’s recovery time. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Framework; Methodology; Physical Rehabilitation; Serious Game,

While many VG-based devices have been developed over the past decade, many have been tested primarily for post-stroke therapy and included limited adaptation capabilities, not to mention personalization. When adaptation was included, it was not implemented dynamically in real-time but rather used to adjust the game parameters before a session. The goal and novel contribution of this study was to examine the potential of dynamic, within-session adaptation of virtual game parameters to support the rehabilitation of children with CP. The iVG4Rehab (Intelligent therapeutic Virtual Gaming System for Rehabilitation) system was designed and developed in collaboration with a team of clinicians. We aimed to demonstrate and evaluate the potential of a personalized virtual gaming system to support and enhance treatment of children with CP by real-time adaptations of game parameters to the children’s abilities and therapeutic needs. Our results validated the hypothesis that personalized system as a tool that has great potential for upper extremity (UE) therapy for children with CP and contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of their underlying performance, usability and kinematics in this unique context. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Personalized Gaming For Rehabilitation; Personalized Rehabilitation; Personalized Virtual Reality For Rehabilitation; Serious Games For Rehabilitation; Diseases; Children With Cerebral Palsies; Children With Disabilities; Game Parameters; Gaming Systems; Personalizations; Real-time Adaptation; Stroke Therapy; Upper Extremity; Patient Rehabilitation,Diseases; Children with cerebral palsies; Children with disabilities; Game parameters; Gaming systems; Personalizations; Real-time adaptation; Stroke therapy; Upper extremity; Patient rehabilitation

Even though some literature reviews have approached this topic from a game perspective and presented a broad overview of the types of video games that have been used in this context, there is still a need to better understand how different game characteristics and development strategies might impact and relate to clinical outcomes. Objective: This review assessed the relationship between the characteristics of serious games (SGs) and their relationship with the clinical outcomes of studies that use this type of therapy in motor impairment rehabilitation of patients with stroke, multiple sclerosis, or cerebral palsy. The purpose was to take a closer look at video game design features described in the literature (game genre [GG], game nature [GN], and game development strategy [GDS]) and assess how they may contribute toward improving health outcomes. Additionally, this review attempted to bring together medical and game development perspectives to facilitate communication between clinicians and game developers, therefore easing the process of choosing the video games to be used for physical rehabilitation. Methods: We analyzed the main features of SG design to obtain significant clinical outcomes when applied to physical rehabilitation of patients recovering from motor impairments resulting from stroke, multiple sclerosis, and cerebral palsy. We implemented a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) database-Adjusted electronic search strategy for the PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Cochrane databases. Results: We screened 623 related papers from 2010-2021 and identified 12 that presented results compatible with our inclusion criteria. A total of 512 participants with stroke (8 studies, 417 participants), cerebral palsy (1 study, 8 participants), and multiple sclerosis (2 studies, 46 participants) were included; 1 study targeting the elderly (41 participants) was also included. All studies assessed motor, sensory, and functional functions, while some also measured general health outcomes. Interventions with games were used for upper-limb motor rehabilitation. Of the 12 studies, 8 presented significant improvements in at least one clinical measurement, of which 6 presented games from the casual GG, 1 combined the casual, simulation, and exergaming GGs, and 2 combined the sports and simulation GGs. Conclusions: Of the possible combinations of game design features (GG, GN, and GDS) described, custom-made casual games that resort to the first-person perspective, do not feature a visible player character, are played in single-player mode, and use nonimmersive virtual reality attain the best results in terms of positive clinical outcomes. In addition, the use of custom-made games versus commercial off-The-shelf games tends to give better clinical results, although the latter are perceived as more motivating and engaging. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cerebral Palsy; Game Characteristics; Game Design; Multiple Sclerosis; Physical Impairment; Physical Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Stroke; Systematic Review,

Playing video games is typically a sedentary endeavor; however, to encourage an increased level of physical activity in an engaging and enjoyable way, active video gaming has become popular. Unfortunately, the accessibility of gaming controllers is often an issue for persons with disabilities. A commercial off-the-shelf (OTS) gaming mat was adapted to facilitate use by individuals with mobility impairments to address this issue. Objective: Our study aimed to examine energy expenditure, enjoyment, and gameplay experience in youth and adults with mobility impairment during active video gaming using an OTS and adapted versions of a gaming mat. Methods: The study used an observational design. During visit 1, physical function was assessed, and participants were given a familiarization period with the gaming system. For visit 2, based on observation during the physical function tests and discussion with the participant, it was decided whether the participant would play in a standing or seated position. For standing gameplay, the mat was placed on the floor, and for seated play, the mat was placed on a height-adjustable and tilt-adjustable tabletop. Metabolic data were collected during a 20-minute baseline and four 10-minute bouts of Wii Fit Plus gameplay, with 2 bouts on each of the mats (adapted and OTS). During gameplay, the research staff observed and rated participants’ ability to use the game controller (mat) and the quality of gameplay. At the end of each game set, participants reported their rating of perceived exertion on a scale from 0 to 10. During rest, participants completed the physical activity enjoyment scale. Participants also answered additional questions regarding the system's usability with each controller (adapted mat and OTS mat). Statistical analyses were computed using Stata 16 (version 16.1; StataCorp). Linear mixed-effects maximum likelihood regression was performed separately for individuals who could play standing and for those who played seated. Results: A convenience sample of 78 individuals with mobility impairments between the ages of 12 and 60 years (mean 39.6, SD 15.8) participated in the study. Of the sample, 48 participants played the video games in a seated position, while 30 played the games standing. Energy expenditure and heart rate tended to be higher in the OTS mat condition for seated players, while values were similar for both conditions among standing players. However, seated participants reported greater gameplay experience, and both groups exhibited a higher quality of gameplay during the adapted mat condition. Conclusions: Active video gaming using an adapted gaming mat provided an enjoyable exercise activity for individuals with mobility impairments. The use of the adapted controller provides a means by which this population can engage in light to moderate intensity active video gaming, thereby reducing sedentary leisure time. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Dance Mat; Disability; Enjoyment; Exercise; Exergaming; Gaming Mat; Mobility Impairment; Physical Activity; Physical Impairment; Serious Games; Video Games,

This mixed reality system allows for serious game play with mirrored and non-mirrored hands, designed for patients with unilateral motor impairments. Before we can ethically have patients use the system, we must show that embodiment can be achieved for healthy users. We compare our approach’s results to previous work in the field and present a study with 48 healthy (non-clinical) participants targeting visual fidelity and self-location. We show that embodiment can be achieved for mirrored and non-mirrored hand representations and that the higher realism of virtual hands achieved by our texturing approach alters perceived embodiment. We further evaluate whether using virtual hands resized to the individual’s hand size affects embodiment. We present a 16-participant study where we could not find a significant difference with personal resized hands.

Combined with wearable augmented reality headset, serious games for gait rehabilitation in a clinical setting can be envisaged, allowing to evolve in a real environment and provide fun and feedback to enhance patient’s motivation. This requires a method to obtain accurate information on the spatiotemporal gait parameters of the playing patient. To this end, we propose a new algorithm called HoloStep that computes spatiotemporal gait parameters using only the head pose provided by an augmented reality headset (Hololens). It is based on the detection of peaks associated to initial contact event, and uses a combination of locking distance, locking time, peak amplitude detection with custom thresholds for children with CP. The performance of HoloStep was compared during a walking session at comfortable speed to Zeni’s reference algorithm, which is based on kinematics and a full 3D motion capture system. Our study included 62 children with cerebral palsy (CP), classified according to Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) between levels I and III, and 13 healthy participants (HP). Metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and precision for step detection with HoloStep were above 96%. The Intra-Class Coefficient between steps length calculated with HoloStep and the reference was 0.92 (GMFCS I), 0.86 (GMFCS II/III) and 0.78 (HP). HoloStep demonstrated good performance when applied to a wide range of gait patterns, including children with CP using walking aids. Findings provide important insights for future gait intervention using augmented reality games for children with CP. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Augmented Reality; Cerebral Palsy; Concurrent Validity; Spatiotemporal Gait Parameters; Wearable Device; Augmented Reality; Diseases; Gait Analysis; Helmet Mounted Displays; Locks (fasteners); Serious Games; 3d Motion Capture Systems; Accuracy And Precision; Children With Cerebral Palsies; Classification System; Gait Rehabilitation; Head Mounted Displays; Intra-class Coefficient; Reference Algorithm; Patient Rehabilitation; Adult; Biomechanics; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Gait; Human; Walking; Adult; Augmented Reality; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Gait; Humans; Smart Glasses; Walking,Augmented reality; Diseases; Gait analysis; Helmet mounted displays; Locks (fasteners); Serious games; 3D motion capture systems; Accuracy and precision; Children with cerebral palsies; Classification system; Gait rehabilitation; Head mounted displays; Intra-class coefficient; Reference algorithm; Patient rehabilitation; adult; biomechanics; cerebral palsy; child; gait; human; walking; Adult; Augmented Reality; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Gait; Humans; Smart Glasses; Walking

Objective: This paper sets out to evaluate the feasibility and potential benefits of using computer serious game in a non-immersive virtual reality (VR) implemented and evaluated completely remotely in participants with CP for Home-Based Telerehabilitation during the quarantine period for COVID-19. Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, a total of 44 individuals participated in this study between March and June 2020, 22 of which had CP (14 males and 8 females, mean age = 19 years, ranging between 11 and 28 years) and 22 typically developing individuals, matched by age and sex to the individuals with CP. Participants practiced a coincident timing game1 and we measured movement performance and physical activity intensity using the rating of perceived exertion Borg scale. Results: All participants were able to engage with the VR therapy remotely, reported enjoying sessions, and improved performance in some practice moments. The most important result in this cross-sectional study was the significant increasing in rating of perceived exertion (through Borg scale) in both groups during practice and with CP presenting a higher rating of perceived exertion. Conclusion: Children with CP enjoyed participating, were able to perform at the same level as their peers on certain activities and increased both their performance and physical activity intensity when using the game, supporting the use of serious games for this group for home therapy and interactive games.

To reduce the costs preserving the quality of services new solutions based on current technologies in the area of physiotherapy are emerging. The remote monitoring of physical training sessions could facilitate for physicians and physical therapists' information about training outcome that may be useful to personalize the exercises helping the patients to achieve better rehabilitation results in short period of time process. This research work aims to apply physical rehabilitation monitoring combining Virtual Reality serious games and Wearable Sensor Network to improve the patient engagement during physical rehabilitation and evaluate their evolution.

Children with neurological disorders, such as cerebral palsy and autism spectrum disorder, have problems with fine motor skills, social interaction, and communication. Such children need to repeat a skill to acquire it. Therapy is needed so that children can develop important life skills and be involved in academic activities. However, children need to undergo long sessions of therapy, which will be tedious for them. Physical therapy can therefore be made interactive and motivating by the use of virtual reality-based games. In this chapter, a virtual reality-based serious gaming platform is proposed for fine motor skills and cognitive development of children with special needs. The Unity3D-based virtual reality environment together with a Leap Motion Controller is used to design the rehabilitation games. The Leap Motion Controller with its gesture recognition ability can provide a cohesive platform to improve the life skills of special needs children. The proposed games are developed in such a way that they improve the pincer grasp, intellectual reasoning, and hand-eye coordination of children. More colorful and fun virtual reality games are developed to keep the children engaged for longer. The developed platform is cost effective, remotely accessible, personalized, and physically less painful. The proposed virtual reality game can also be used as an auxiliary tool along with traditional rehabilitation methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cognitive Development; Fine Motor Skills; Leap Motion Controller; Rehabilitation Therapy; Serious Games; Unity3d; Virtual Reality,

METHODS: Twenty-five children with CP, aged 5 to 18 years were randomly selected for experimental or control groups. Over a period of two weeks, all participants received 8-9 game sessions for 15-20 minutes, totaling 150-160 minutes. The experimental group used personalized balance games available from the GAmification for Better LifE (GABLE) online serious gaming platform. Children from the control group played Nintendo Wii games using a handheld Wii Remote. Both groups received the same background treatment. Recorded outcome measures were from a Trunk Control Measurement Scale (TCMS), Timed Up Go Test (TUG), Center of Pressure Path Length (COP-PL), and Dynamic Balance Test (DBT). RESULTS: After two weeks of training in the experimental group TCMS scores increased by 4.5 points (SD = 3.5, p< 0.05) and DBT results increased by 0.88 points (IQR = 1.03, p< 0.05) while these scores did not change significantly in the control group. Overall, TUG and COP-PL scores were not affected in either group. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates improvement of balancing function in children with CP after a two-week course of training with personalized rehabilitation computer games. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Game Therapy; Neurological Disorders; Physical Therapy; Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Adolescent; Adult; Article; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Clinical Article; Controlled Study; Female; Game; Human; Male; Motor Dysfunction Assessment; Outcome Assessment; Pediatric Patient; Quasi Experimental Study; Timed Up And Go Test; Video Game; Body Equilibrium; Kinesiotherapy; Pilot Study; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Exercise Therapy; Humans; Pilot Projects; Postural Balance; Video Games,adolescent; adult; Article; cerebral palsy; child; clinical article; controlled study; female; game; human; male; motor dysfunction assessment; outcome assessment; pediatric patient; quasi experimental study; timed up and go test; video game; body equilibrium; kinesiotherapy; pilot study; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Exercise Therapy; Humans; Pilot Projects; Postural Balance; Video Games

Research studies have proven the benefits of technologies based on home-rehabilitation, which complement regular therapy in hospitals. Although there is a significant number of studies that face this challenge when dealing with adults, it has not been explored with young people. In this research article, we focus on this population, since the repetition of physical exercises decreases the youth’s motivation, which entails a high risk of dropping out of therapy. That is why we present a systematic mapping study of the techniques, devices, and methods used to address home rehabilitation for children and teenagers. The conclusions indicate that it is essential to use gamification techniques to adopt a plug-and-play metaphor, based on natural interaction mechanisms and on the use of non-intrusive devices, and to customize the rehabilitation process for each individual along with a methodology. We also present the improvements applied to an existing gamification-based software prototype for home rehabilitation. In this system, physical exercises can be customized, laying the foundations to promote precision rehabilitation within the context of young people. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Gamification; Home-based Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Systematic Mapping Study; Young People,

One of the advantages in using this technology is the potential to create positive motivation, by means of engaging environments and tasks shaped in the form of serious games. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of immersive Virtual Environments and weaRable hAptic devices (VERA) for rehabilitation of upper limb in children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) and Developmental Dyspraxia (DD). Methods: A two period cross-over design was adopted for determining the differences between the proposed therapy and a conventional treatment. Eight children were randomized into two groups: one group received the VERA treatment in the first period and the manual therapy in the second period, and viceversa for the other group. Children were assessed at the beginning and the end of each period through both the Nine Hole Peg Test (9-HPT, primary outcome) and Kinesiological Measurements obtained during the performing of similar tasks in a real setting scenario (secondary outcomes). Results: All subjects, not depending from which group they come from, significantly improved in both the performance of the 9-HPT and in the parameters of the kinesiological measurements (movement error and smoothness). No statistically significant differences have been found between the two groups. Conclusions: These findings suggest that immersive VE and wearable haptic devices is a viable alternative to conventional therapy for improving upper extremity function in children with neuromotor impairments.

Most stroke survivors suffer from motor impairment, where rehabilitation helps to regain lost abilities. Rehabilitation is a long process that focuses on repeating exercises, which are monotonous and time consuming. As a consequence, patients loose interest and motivation. Serious games offer the possibility to deliver rehabilitation exercises in combination with entertaining and motivating aspects. A variety of serious games using additional hardware is available to support stroke patients. In this article, the authors propose a new and innovative serious game, which relies only on integrated sensors of a smartphone. Development was based on a user-centered design approach divided into two phases. In phase 1, requirements were identified in cooperation with a therapist and 13 stroke patients. The developed serious game included different levels of difficulty for movement, gesture, and touch exercises. Additional feedback and requirements from therapists and medical doctors were included in phase 2, which resulted in an advanced solution with additional levels. Gathered feedback showed a positive attitude toward the proposed solution. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Mobile Application; Serious Game; Stroke; Electronic Medical Equipment; Feedback; Mhealth; Motivation; Patient Rehabilitation; User Centered Design; Integrated Sensors; Medical Doctors; Motor Impairments; Positive Attitude; Prototypical Implementation; Rehabilitation Exercise; Stroke Patients; Stroke Survivors; Serious Games,Electronic medical equipment; Feedback; mHealth; Motivation; Patient rehabilitation; User centered design; Integrated sensors; Medical doctors; Motor impairments; Positive attitude; Prototypical implementation; Rehabilitation exercise; Stroke patients; Stroke survivors; Serious games

We describe the user-centered design process of this system, which is composed of a wrist-worn inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a tangible device with an embedded IMU. The system employs a quaternion-based algorithm for automatic real-time estimation of the range of motion (RoM) covered by adduction/abduction and flexion/extension motions of the wrist. Experimental validation shows that the RoM can be determined with sufficient accuracy to control a game and that the algorithm is applicable in CCP. A serious game, which uses the presented algorithm and enables feedback as well as motivating stimuli, is implemented and evaluated by physiotherapists. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Home-based Motor Training; Human-technology Interaction; Inertial Sensor Fusion; Intelligent Biomedical Systems; Motion State Estimation; Rehabilitation Engineering; Serious Game Design; User-centered Design,

Motivation, repetition, variability and feedback are key elements in improving and relearning a new walking pattern. As a preamble to the development of an AR rehabilitation game, and in order to choose the most effective feedback to provide to the patient, this article presents a preliminary study on the impact of presentation modalities on walking speed. We investigate which visual concurrent feedback modalities allows to reach and maintain a target speed (maximum or intermediate). Our first results on children with motor disabilities (n=10) show that some modalities improved walking performance and helped patients to better control their walking speed. In particular, a combination of targets anchored in the real world with a time indication seems to be effective in maintaining maximum walking speed, while simple moving objects could be used to control speed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Augmented Reality; Cerebral Palsy; Feedback; Serious Game; Walking Rehabilitation; Augmented Reality; Feedback; Serious Games; Speed; Augmented Feedback; Key Elements; Motor Disability; Motor Learning; Moving Objects; Target Speed; Walking Pattern; Walking Speed; Patient Rehabilitation,Augmented reality; Feedback; Serious games; Speed; Augmented feedback; Key elements; Motor disability; Motor learning; Moving objects; Target speed; Walking pattern; Walking speed; Patient rehabilitation

To control viral transmission, social distancing measures have been implemented all over the world, interrupting the access to routine medical care for many individuals with neurological diseases. Cognitive disorders are common in many neurological conditions, e.g., stroke, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, and other types of dementia, Parkinson's disease and parkinsonian syndromes, and multiple sclerosis, and should be addressed by cognitive rehabilitation interventions. To be effective, cognitive rehabilitation programs must be intensive and prolonged over time; however, the current virus containment measures are hampering their implementation. Moreover, the reduced access to cognitive rehabilitation might worsen the relationship between the patient and the healthcare professional. Urgent measures to address issues connected to COVID-19 pandemic are, therefore, needed. Remote communication technologies are increasingly regarded as potential effective options to support health care interventions, including neurorehabilitation and cognitive rehabilitation. Among them, telemedicine, virtual reality, augmented reality, and serious games could be in the forefront of these efforts. We will briefly review current evidence-based recommendations on the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation and offer a perspective on the role of tele- and virtual rehabilitation to achieve adequate cognitive stimulation in the era of social distancing related to COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we will discuss issues related to their diffusion and propose a roadmap to address them.

Training can increase the hemiparetic arm workspace and the performance of circular design in these patients. Thus, this paper presents a robot actuated by cables that can be used in rehabilitation producing circular trajectories. First, the circular trajectory and mathematical model to keep the cables in tension are presented. Next, a serious game is described that uses the circular trajectory for stroke rehabilitation. The results showed that the predictive equation proposed in the present paper represented the experimental data with an average relative error of only 1%.

The sample consisted of eleven elements aged from 17 years to 83 years, with neurological diseases in a mild or moderate state, with sequelae such as hemiparesis, paraparesis, hemidystonia, cerebellar syndrome and hemihyposthesia. Each patient used the game in twice a week in sessions of physical therapy, with the duration of about thirty minutes, for twelve to fifteen sessions. In each session, the patient performed several challenges, for two and a half minutes or five minutes each, according to his/her physiotherapeutic plan. Results: All the patients suffered oscillations in their behavior, but with better or worse performances, higher or lower scores, they were able to successfully complete the different exercises provided by Physioland, which are part of their physiotherapeutic plans. Conclusion: Based on the results obtained it can be said that it was possible to adapt specific exercises of traditional physical therapy to situations of electronic game, reason why Physioland fulfills the objective of monitoring the practice of physical therapy of patients with reduced mobility as a consequence of neurological disease. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Computer Vision; Motivation; Neurological Diseases; Physical Rehabilitation; Serious Game; Computer Vision; Disease Control; Image Processing; Motivation; Neurology; Patient Treatment; Physical Therapy; Clinical Environments; Electronic Games; Hemiparesis; Image Processing Technique; Neurological Disease; Physical Rehabilitation; Serious Games,Computer vision; Disease control; Image processing; Motivation; Neurology; Patient treatment; Physical therapy; Clinical environments; Electronic games; Hemiparesis; Image processing technique; Neurological disease; Physical rehabilitation; Serious games

Because intelligent serious games can provide personalized learning opportunities, motivate the learner, teach 21st-century skills, and provide an environment for authentic and relevant assessment, they may be used to help children and adolescents with different kinds of learning disabilities to develop social and cognitive competences. Objective: The aim of the study was to produce and evaluate a suite of intelligent serious games based on accessible learning objectives for improving key skills, personal development, and work sustainability among children with learning difficulties. Methods: We conducted this research between 2016 and 2018, with pupils aged 11 to 12 years with learning disabilities who were integrated into the mainstream educational system. We used a 4-step methodology to develop learner creativity and social competences: (1) needs analysis, (2) development of learning content, (3) development of intelligent serious games, and (4) a usability evaluation focusing on the research questions and hypothesis. This was based on an initial teachers’ evaluation, using a survey, of students using 2 of the games, where the main goal was to determine user motivation and initiative and to improve the games and the evaluation process. The initial evaluation was followed by a pilot evaluation, which was performed for all proposed games, in all partner countries. Results: In an initial evaluation with 51 participants from Slovenia consisting of a pretest, followed by intelligent serious game intervention and concluding with a posttest, we observed statistically significant improvement in social and cognitive competences measured by tests. Based on these findings and observations, we improved the games and evaluation process. In the pilot test, conducted in all participating countries on a sample of 93 participants, the mean score on the teachers’ observation form on the pretest (before students began using the intelligent serious games) was 3.9. In the posttest, after students had used intelligent serious games, the mean score was 4.1. Conclusions: We focused on developing and evaluating intelligent serious games for persons with learning disabilities, particularly for students with disabilities who are integrated into the mainstream educational system. Such games provide an opportunity for personalized learning and should be tailored to ensure that every learner can achieve the highest standard possible. However, we recommend that the games be adapted based on the students’ needs and capabilities and a specially developed curriculum. The collected feedback showed that (1) children with learning disabilities need appropriately developed intelligent serious games, and (2) intelligent serious games, and the pertaining didactic methodology, should be based on an interoperable curriculum, so that teachers and trainers can use them. The student survey confirmed improvements in all aspects. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cognitive Competence; Experimental; Intellectual Disability; Learning Disabilities; Serious Games; Social Skills,

Background. Cerebral palsy (CP) taxonomically encompasses spastic, ataxic dyskinetic and non-classifiable types and, together with the elementary motor deficit, disbalance limits the affected individuals’ orthostatic and ambulatory capacity, thus balance rehabilitation representing an important stake in (re)gaining functional autonomy. Physiatric advanced approaches such as those mentioned in the title, for specific equilibrium function evaluation and (re)training, seem to be contributive in this respect. Material and methods. In order to achieve an adequate documentation in the domain of the above mentioned rather new and complex assessment and rehabilitative procedures, we have conducted a systematic literature review following the methodology of the ""Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes (""PRISMA""). Pursuing this goal, we searched for eligible (see further in the body text of our work) articles, by specific keywords combinations (”syntaxes” – consensually) in five international medical databases: Elsevier, NCBI/PubMed, NCBI/PMC, Cochrane and PEDro, availing in addition, the ISI Web of Knowledge/Science Database, in order to check if the articles were issued in jornals indexed in there. Results. After fulfilling the selection/ filtering above mentioned standardized endeavor, it resulted 11 qualified and contributive articles, as well. In purpose to strongly enhance our documentation base, we used also free identified bibliographic resources. Discussion. There is a current and foreseeable further development in the future – technologically for fabrication and respectively, of their technical performances – including as regards the devices used (also) for stabilometric and virtual reality based equilibrium assessment and rehabilitation in cerebral palsy, considering their beneficial effects. Yet, at least partially, some of them are not completely anodyne. Conclusion. As in most situations, the related methodology of indication and administration can make the difference – so, an as much as possible exhaustive knowledge in this field, too, is necessary and prone to elicit best post intervention outcomes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",(computerized) Stabilometry/static Posturography; (inter)/active (electronic/video)/“serious Games”; Augmented/ Virtual Reality; Balance (re)training/rehabilitation; Cerebral Palsy; Equilibrium Disorder; Puberty/adolescence,

By using an AR electronic device, we can blend the real world with a virtual one in real time. Gamification in healthcare interventions helps patients adopt a healthier lifestyle in various aspects of their lives. In this direction, there is ample space for exploration in the field of alternative treatments for diseases like Parkinson’s disease (PD). Among the various game categories targeting PD patients’ rehabilitation, exergames, that focus on the main exercises employed in the interventions phase of early-stage PD patients, gain great popularity. The reason is that physical activity is a key concept for delaying motor and functional loss of early-stage PD patients. In this context, this work presents HoloPrognosis, an AR-based serious exercise game targeting the mitigation of upper limbs motor impairment of early-stage PD patients. More specifically, the game motivates the patients to reach large amplitude movements progressively while tracking their performance and collecting data related to hand movement for further analysis. Unlike other similar efforts, AR offers the advantages of augmented engagement and user experience, real first-person experience and authentic human body controls. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Augmented Reality; Parkinson’s Disease; Serious Game; Augmented Reality; Patient Rehabilitation; Patient Treatment; Serious Games; User Experience; Electronic Device; First Person; Functional Loss; Hand Movement; Human Bodies; Large Amplitude; Motor Impairments; Physical Activity; Human Computer Interaction,Augmented reality; Patient rehabilitation; Patient treatment; Serious games; User experience; Electronic device; First person; Functional loss; Hand movement; Human bodies; Large amplitude; Motor impairments; Physical activity; Human computer interaction

Digital interactive games could support the standard treatments. We aimed to review clinical studies which investigated the application of serious games in children with developmental disabilities. Methods: We searched MEDLINE and Scopus on 05 May 2019 limited to the English language. We included people between two and 24 years of age who were affected by neurodevelopmental disorders and who received digital serious game-based medical interventions such as any computer-based or video-based games. We considered any study design reporting primary data. We used title, abstract, and full-text of journal articles to build diagnostic groups, and we described some selected specific game applications. Results: The majority of the 145 relevant studies reported on autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental coordination disorder (DCD), and disabilities affecting intellectual abilities (DAIA). 30 of the 145 studies reported a randomized design. We detailed six specific applications aimed at improving abilities in children with ASD, ADHD, cerebral palsy, and Down syndrome. We visualized the diagnostic groups by bibliographic mapping, and limited the text to the title and abstract of journal articles. Conclusion: We identified promising results regarding anxiety reduction, stress regulation, emotion recognition, and rehabilitation. Currently, there appears to be a lack of clinical evidence that children with neurodevelopmental disorders can benefit from the application of serious games. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Children; Developmental Coordination Disorder; Disabilities Affecting Intellectual Abilities; Game-based Intervention; Anxiety; Attention Deficit Disorder; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Cognition; Dementia; Depression; Developmental Coordination Disorder; Developmental Delay; Down Syndrome; Dyslexia; Emotion; Game; Health Promotion; Human; Information Technology; Intellectual Impairment; Internet Addiction; Medical Education; Mental Disease; Motor Performance; Physical Activity; Priority Journal; Randomized Controlled Trial (topic); Resident; Review; Scientific Literature; Social Competence; Social Interaction; Traumatic Brain Injury; Working Memory; Adolescent; Developmental Disorder; Play Therapy; Preschool Child; Procedures; Video Game; Young Adult; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Developmental Disabilities; Humans; Play Therapy; Video Games; Young Adult","anxiety; attention deficit disorder; cerebral palsy; child; cognition; dementia; depression; developmental coordination disorder; developmental delay; Down syndrome; dyslexia; emotion; game; health promotion; human; information technology; intellectual impairment; internet addiction; medical education; mental disease; motor performance; physical activity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); resident; Review; scientific literature; social competence; social interaction; traumatic brain injury; working memory; adolescent; developmental disorder; play therapy; preschool child; procedures; video game; young adult; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Developmental Disabilities; Humans; Play Therapy; Video Games; Young Adult"

This work presents a strategy to support human- computer interactions for children with a disability in their upper limbs through a wearable device, with the objective of improving access to digital games for the target audience. For the development of this work, the wearable device Myo was used to control a puzzle game as a means of providing the interaction between the individual and the game. In this context, the game is controlled with the movement of the user’s upper limb that presents the disability, through the Myo device. For the validation of this research, the game developed was made available for individuals presenting a disability in the upper limbs, from an age range between five and fifteen years old, of the Association of Assistance to the Disabled Child (AACD). Soon, it was noticed that the participants of the research soon could play while utilizing the deficient limb with Myo’s support and felt more motivated to play. On the long run, it is expected to contribute to the motivation of patients through technological innovation, so that the process of body consciousness is made more interactive. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Digital Games; Physical Disability; Upper Limbs; Wearables; Adolescent; Child; Computer Interface; Equipment Design; Female; Handicapped Child; Human; Male; Motivation; Motor Dysfunction; Questionnaire; Video Game; Adolescent; Child; Disabled Children; Equipment Design; Female; Humans; Male; Motivation; Movement Disorders; Surveys And Questionnaires; User-computer Interface; Video Games,adolescent; child; computer interface; equipment design; female; handicapped child; human; male; motivation; motor dysfunction; questionnaire; video game; Adolescent; Child; Disabled Children; Equipment Design; Female; Humans; Male; Motivation; Movement Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires; User-Computer Interface; Video Games

It has been illustrated that utility of this technology can improve the physical skills of children with cerebral palsy. In this paper, we have presented a novel VR therapy game in which the children get motivated to do different activities according to their physiotherapy schedule and finally the child's behavior was automatically assessed. The game consists of a virtual playground with a virtual robot that guides the children between different items and encourages them to do their best during the designed assignments. Furthermore, we managed a pilot game-session to study the acceptance of the VR game and we observed that the acceptance rate is about 75% among children with cerebral palsy, while all of the typically developing children attending the session enjoyed the game. Finally, by investigating the results, it is indicated that the performance of CPs in all the activities was significantly weaker than their typically developing peers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cerebral Palsy; Physical Rehabilitation; Range Of Motion; Sports Training; Virtual Reality; Agricultural Robots; Physical Therapy; Robotics; Virtual Reality; Acceptance Rate; Children With Cerebral Palsies; Emerging Technologies; Modern Technologies; Sequential Movements; Virtual Robots; Diseases,Agricultural robots; Physical therapy; Robotics; Virtual reality; Acceptance rate; Children with cerebral palsies; Emerging technologies; Modern technologies; Sequential movements; Virtual robots; Diseases

Owing to their affordability and use of hand-free controllers, vision-based systems have gradually been integrated into motor rehabilitation programs and have greatly drawn the interest of healthcare practitioners and the research community. Many studies have illustrated the effectiveness of these systems in rehabilitation. However, the report and design aspects of the reported clinical trials were disregarded. Objective: In this paper, we present a systematic literature review of the use of vision-based serious games and virtual reality systems in motor rehabilitation programs. We aim to propose a research methodology that engineers can use to improve the designing and reporting processes of their clinical trials. Methods: We conducted a review of published studies that entail clinical experiments. Searches were performed using Web of Science and Medline (PubMed) electronic databases, and selected studies were assessed using the Downs and Black Checklist and then analyzed according to specific research questions. Results: We identified 86 studies and our findings indicate that the number of studies in this field is increasing, with Korea and USA in the lead. We found that Kinect, EyeToy system, and GestureTek IREX are the most commonly used technologies in studying the effects of vision-based serious games and virtual reality systems on rehabilitation. Findings also suggest that cerebral palsy and stroke patients are the main target groups, with a particular interest on the elderly patients in this target population. The findings indicate that most of the studies focused on postural control and upper extremity exercises and used different measurements during assessment. Conclusions: Although the research community's interest in this area is growing, many clinical trials lack sufficient clarity in many aspects and are not standardized.

One reason for this popularity is due to the availability of low cost tracking sensors. We present a serious game interface that uses the Leap Motion sensor (coupled to Gear VR headset) for manual function rehabilitation. A monitoring system was developed so that the patient can use the game at home without losing their data. One therapist and five people with Cerebral Palsy used the system in a virtual rehabilitation. We investigated the individual performance of each participant (through counting points by time), satisfaction (through the System Usability Scale - SUS), cybersickness symptoms (through the Simulation Sickness Questionnaire - SSQ) and the level of active participation measured with the Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale (PRPS). Tests allow that the system has a good acceptance to be used in rehabilitation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cerebral Palsy; Game Therapy; Leap Motion; Motor Rehabilitation; Usability; Virtual Reality; Acceptance Tests; Diseases; E-learning; Motion Sensors; Serious Games; Virtual Reality; Cerebral Palsy; Game Therapy; Leap Motion; Motor Rehabilitation; Usability; Patient Rehabilitation,Acceptance tests; Diseases; E-learning; Motion sensors; Serious games; Virtual reality; Cerebral palsy; Game therapy; Leap motion; Motor rehabilitation; Usability; Patient rehabilitation

The platform is a rhythm game wherein hand gestures are used as input and must match the rhythm and gestures shown on screen, thus allowing a physical therapist to represent an exercise session as a series of patterns involving the user's hand and finger joints. Fine motor rehabilitation plays an important role in the recovery and improvement of the effects of diseases and conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, among many others. Individuals with these conditions possess a wide range of impairments such as fine motor movement. The proposed serious game is adaptive to the player to enable access to patients across a wide range of ability. In two pilot studies in collaboration with the South West Advanced Neurological Rehabilitation (SWAN Rehab) in Phoenix, Arizona, we compared the performance of individuals with fine motor impairment to individuals without impairment to determine the accessibility of the proposed serious game, i.e., to assess whether the platform is adaptive to a user's range of motion to allow an individual with fine motor impairment to perform at a similar level as a non-impaired user. We also separately evaluated the adaptive calibration algorithm to understand its impact on an individual's performance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Leap Motion; Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Patient Rehabilitation; Adaptive Calibration; Finger Joints; Leap Motion; Motion Controller; Multiple Sclerosis; Neurological Rehabilitation; Parkinson's Disease; Range Of Motions; Serious Games,Patient rehabilitation; Adaptive calibration; Finger joints; Leap Motion; Motion controller; Multiple sclerosis; Neurological rehabilitation; Parkinson's disease; Range of motions; Serious games

The proposed method provides an easy-to-access and affordable way for forearm axial angle estimation when arm is at different positions relative to torso and when tracking devices are worn in different orientations.

While there are treatments to reduce the impact of the impairment on the patient's life, they can be either very costly or be alternative methods that are not directly aimed at rehabilitation purposes, such as the usage of Kinect Adventures to make the patient perform favorable poses and stretching limbs to help the undergoing treatment. Even though a low-cost device, the Kinect can acquire valuable data and make the patient perform exercises. However, a more direct and targeted approach might achieve better results with a game aimed for them. To attend to the many forms and variations of motor impairments, a starting point may be necessary for the development of exergames that fulfill the needs of each patient and impairment.

The University of Valladolid neuromuscular training system, UVa-NTS platform, which allows the myoelectric command of computer applications, has been introduced in rehabilitation sessions of a group of paraplegic patients. The experiments took place both at the University of Valladolid and at the National Hospital for Paraplegics of Toledo in Spain. A homogeneous population of five patients with a C7 spinal cord injury was compared with a group of control subjects. The myoelectric control was performed with the flexor carpi radialis and the extensor carpi radialis muscles. The myoelectric routines were timed and the game scores measured. Notwithstanding the reduced mobility of the patients, they achieved fast adaptation and better timings than the control subjects in the first experiment (p < 0.001), although this difference was reduced in further experiments. Both patients and control subjects played satisfactorily with the Myo-Pong game. However, the improvement in the scores was better for the control subjects between sessions (p = 0.009) when compared with the patients (p = 0.978). The results show that patients and control subjects were able to perform and reached similar scores. However, patients' improvement in further rehabilitation sessions was lesser than when compared with the control subjects. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Biofeedback; Electromyography; Myoelectric Control; Real-time; Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Spinal Cord Injury,

Hence, measurement of relevant outcomes, such as self-reliance and participation, is needed. The Impact on Participation and Autonomy (IPA) questionnaire for rehabilitation clients was adapted for social support, called IPA-MO, and its validity and reliability were tested among social support clients in eight municipalities in 2014 and 2016. Methods: The total research sample comprised of 4120 persons. Homogeneous subgroups were distinguished based on 1) disability and 2) age. Exploratory factor analysis (PCF) was used to identify domains for IPA-MO. Model fit was assessed with Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) using structural equation modelling. Results: PCF revealed that the IPA-MO model consists of all five original IPA domains: Autonomy indoors, Family role, Autonomy outdoors, Social life and relations, and Work and education. As a result of new items added, a new, sixth domain was developed: Financial autonomy. Due to high non-response on Work & education, construct validity was first tested for a five-domain IPA-MO model. The composition of the IPA-MO domains showed slight differences: The item on 'mobility indoor' shifted from Autonomy indoors (IPA) to Family Role in IPA-MO. The item on reciprocity shifted from Social Life and relations (IPA) to Autonomy outdoors (IPA-MO). Internal reliability was confirmed for all domains (Cronbach's alpha >.80). CFA showed acceptable construct validity of the five-domain IPA-MO model for the social support population (CFI.936, TLI.925, SRMR.051), all age groups and most disability-based groups. Construct validity including Work & education was tested for 234 participants. Then, PCF revealed six domains and the model fit was acceptable (CFI.915, TLI.903, SRMR.067). Conclusions: IPA-MO is a valid and reliable instrument to assess outcomes of social support. Further research on the domain Financial autonomy is needed. Social-support clients are numerous and dispersed and, in spite of the best intentions, hard to involve widely in policy processes. A valid outcome measure offers municipalities possibilities to gain insight in social costs and benefits of new policies. Outcome measurement also allows to contract bundled-services of providers, thereby changing the incentives for providers from increasing production to much needed innovation. Taking the perceptions of autonomy and participation of social-support clients as the acid test for the effectiveness of social support policies, may prove a serious game-changer in politics. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autonomy; Factor Analysis; Impairment; Ipa; Participation; Social Support; Validation; Adult; Age; Aged; Article; Cognitive Defect; Confirmatory Factor Analysis; Construct Validity; Controlled Study; Cronbach Alpha Coefficient; Educational Status; Employment Status; Exploratory Factor Analysis; Family Relation; Female; Financial Statement; Human; Impact On Participation And Autonomy Questionnaire; Major Clinical Study; Male; Mathematical Model; Mental Deficiency; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment; Personal Autonomy; Physical Disability; Population Research; Questionnaire; Reliability; Social Interaction; Social Life; Social Participation; Social Support; Statistical Model; Validation Study; Very Elderly; Young Adult; Classification; Daily Life Activity; Disabled Person; Factor Analysis; Legislation And Jurisprudence; Netherlands; Psychology; Quality Of Life; Reproducibility; Standards; Statistics And Numerical Data; Activities Of Daily Living; Adult; Aged; Disabled Persons; Economic Status; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Family Relations; Female; Humans; Male; Quality Of Life; Reproducibility Of Results; Social Support; Surveys And Questionnaires","adult; age; aged; Article; cognitive defect; confirmatory factor analysis; construct validity; controlled study; Cronbach alpha coefficient; educational status; employment status; exploratory factor analysis; family relation; female; financial statement; human; Impact on Participation and Autonomy questionnaire; major clinical study; male; mathematical model; mental deficiency; middle aged; outcome assessment; personal autonomy; physical disability; population research; questionnaire; reliability; social interaction; social life; social participation; social support; statistical model; validation study; very elderly; young adult; classification; daily life activity; disabled person; factor analysis; legislation and jurisprudence; Netherlands; psychology; quality of life; reproducibility; standards; statistics and numerical data; Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Aged; Disabled Persons; Economic Status; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Family Relations; Female; Humans; Male; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Social Support; Surveys and Questionnaires"

Serious game characteristics (target position, level of assistance/resistance, level of force) are typically adapted based on the child's assessment before and continuously during the game (measuring UL working area, kinematics and muscle strength). OBJECTIVE: This study developed an UL robotic motor assessment protocol to configure the serious game. METHODS: Forty-nine healthy children and 20 CP children participated in the study. The clinical assessment consisted of the child's UL length and isometric force. The robot assessment consisted of the child's UL working area (WA), the UL isometric and isokinetic force in three directions and the UL kinematics during a pointing task toward targets placed at different distances. RESULTS: Results showed that WA and UL isometric force were moderately to highly correlated with clinical measures. Ratios between the UL isokinetic force generated on three directions were established. The velocity and straightness indexes of all children increased when they had to reach to targets placed more distant. CONCLUSIONS: This protocol can be integrated into different serious games in order to continuously configure the game characteristics to a child's performance.

In this chapter, we systematically review the use of RGB-D serious games in motor rehabilitation programs and survey the state of the art. The chapter then focuses on the design of serious games for motor rehabilitation therapy and where we present a development framework and implementation guidelines for RGB-D interactive systems for motor rehabilitation therapy and therapeutic measurements. In RGB-D-based interactive systems, users stand in front of the screen and interact with the video game using their body movements. We describe a RGB-D nonparametric approach for background subtraction, that uses both depth and color information in a unified way, to segment the patient. Finally, we show three different case studies where we applied the presented method. The first one consists of an interactive system based on a RGB-D sensor to calculate the Functional Reach Test (FRT). The second one consists on a RGB-D interactive system to improve the balance and postural control of adults with cerebral palsy. The last one consists of three serious games to improve the balance and postural control in elderly people.

However, there are people that, for some physical disability, are not able to, or don't feel motivated to play. In this perspective, this work presents a strategy to support human-computer interactions for children with a disability in their upper limbs through a wearable device, with the objective of improving access to digital games for the target audience. For the development of this work, the wearable device Myo was used to control a puzzle game as a means of providing the interaction between the individual and the game. In this context, the game is controlled with the movement of the user's upper limb that presents the disability, through the Myo device. For the validation of this research, the game developed was made available for individuals presenting a disability in the upper limbs, from an age range between five and fifteen years old, of the Association of Assistance to the Disabled Child (AADC). Soon, it was noticed that the participants of the research soon could play while utilizing the deficient limb with Myo's support and felt more motivated to play. On the long run, it's expected to contribute to the motivation of patients through technological innovation, so that the process of body consciousness is made more interactive, attractive and playful. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Biomedical Informatics; Microsensors; Wearable Computers; Human Computer Interaction; Microsensors; Motivation; Serious Games; Wearable Computers; Biomedical Informatics; Disabled Children; Medical Fields; Physical Disability; Physical Limitations; Target Audience; Technological Innovation; Wearable Devices; Wearable Technology,Human computer interaction; Microsensors; Motivation; Serious games; Wearable computers; Biomedical informatics; Disabled children; Medical fields; Physical disability; Physical limitations; Target audience; Technological innovation; Wearable devices; Wearable technology

Methods: Sixteen PD patients with mild cognitive and motor impairments were included (mean [SD] age 65 [7.28] years and Hoehn & Yahr score 2–3). Rehabilitation consisted of a 6-week at-home training program targeting rhythmic skills with a dedicated SG, Rhythm Workers, implemented on a tablet device. Patients were asked to play the game at least 30 min, 3 times a week. Two half-day evaluations were conducted before and after rehabilitation. Time played and average game scores were recorded. Suitability was evaluated by a questionnaire inspired by the Suitability Evaluation Questionnaire (SEQ) and rhythmic skills by the Beat Alignment Test from the Battery for the Assessment of Auditory Sensorimotor and Timing Abilities (BAASTA). Results: Patients played a mean (SD) of 313 (243) min, namely 57.9% of the expected time; the mean game score was 48.8/100 (19.5). The mean SEQ score for 12 patients was 29.2/45 (8.2); suitability was good to excellent for 10 patients. Beat perception reflecting rhythmic skills improved significantly in all but 5 patients.

Clinical assessment tools commonly used for FRDA become less effective in evaluating decay in patients with advanced FRDA, particularly when they are in a wheelchair. Further motor worsening mainly impairs upper limb function. In this study, we tested if serious games (SG) developed for rehabilitation can be used as an assessment tool for upper limb function even in patients with advanced FRDA. Methods: A specific SG has been developed for physical rehabilitation of patients suffering from neurologic diseases. The use of this SG, coupled with Kinect sensor, has been validated to perform functional evaluation of the upper limbs with healthy subjects across lifespan. Twenty-seven FRDA patients were included in the study. Patients were invited to perform upper limb rehabilitation exercises embedded in SG. Motions were recorded by the Kinect and clinically relevant parameters were extracted from the collected motions. We tested if the existence of correlations between the scores from the serious games and the severity of the disease using clinical assessment tools commonly used for FRDA. Results of patients were compared with a group a healthy subjects of similar age. Results: Very highly significant differences were found for time required to perform the exercise (increase of 76%, t(68) = 7.22, P < 0.001) and for accuracy (decrease of 6%, t(68) = - 3.69, P < 0.001) between patients and healthy subjects. Concerning the patients significant correlations were found between age and time (R = 0.65, p = 0.015), accuracy (R = - 0.75, p = 0.004) and the total displacement of upper limbs. (R = 0.55, p = 0.031). Statistically significant correlations were found between the age of diagnosis and speed related parameters. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that SG reliably captures motor impairment of FRDA patients due to cerebellar and pyramidal involvement. Results also show that functional evaluation of FRDA patients can be performed during rehabilitation therapy embedded in games with the patient seated in a wheelchair.

Additionally, the impact of self-efficacy, adherence, knowledge, use of theory, parent involvement, and study quality was also examined. Materials and Methods: Searches were conducted in databases EBSCO, PubMed, and Web of Science between June and August 2016. Randomized controlled trials using a serious game as an intervention, for participants under 18 years of age, to improve their chronic disease were included. Results: Data were extracted by two independent researchers, including: Title, author, and publication year; chronic disease; game description; number and age of participants; intervention duration; significant findings; parent involvement; theory; and study quality. Any disagreements were tackled and consensus was achieved. Eighteen studies were included in the review. The areas of health addressed included cerebral palsy, asthma, diabetes, developmental coordination disorders, and vision disorders. In these articles, eight health outcome variables were measured, including: lung function, glycemic control, hospital visits, motor proficiency, and visual acuity. Psychosocial variables that were assessed included self-efficacy and knowledge. Two articles included parents in the intervention, and three articles used theory. Six studies had significant health outcome finding, and four studies found a significant change in one psychosocial variable. Conclusion: This review demonstrates the potential for games to improve health outcomes of young individuals. However, the mixed results suggest that more serious game interventions need to be better designed and rigorously tested to support their impact on improving health outcomes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Children/adolescents; Chronic Disease; Serious Games; Systematic Review; Adolescent; Child; Chronic Disease; Devices; Human; Play Therapy; Preschool Child; Procedures; Psychology; Quality Of Life; Recreational Game; Self Concept; Standards; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Chronic Disease; Games, Recreational; Humans; Play Therapy; Quality Of Life; Self Efficacy","adolescent; child; chronic disease; devices; human; play therapy; preschool child; procedures; psychology; quality of life; recreational game; self concept; standards; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Chronic Disease; Games, Recreational; Humans; Play Therapy; Quality of Life; Self Efficacy"

This article describes the development of an electrooculography (EOG) system to control a serious computer game. The goal is to allow people with motor disabilities to play a serious game and improve control over their oculomotor systems. The developed system consists of three subsystems: a low-cost hardware device to acquire the EOG signals, methods to process them digitally, and a serious game controlled exclusively by eye movements. Fourteen able-bodied volunteers of different ages and genders tested the computer game. The evaluation of the system's interaction capacity with the computer game was based on three metrics: score obtained, number of successful interactions, and number of errors committed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Disabled People; Electrooculography (eog); Machine Learning; Serious Games; Wavelet Transform; Computer Control Systems; Electrooculography; Eye Movements; Learning Systems; Wavelet Transforms; Different Ages; Disabled People; Eog Signal; Low Cost Hardware; Motor Disability; Motor Systems; Oculomotor Systems; Serious Games,Computer control systems; Electrooculography; Eye movements; Learning systems; Wavelet transforms; Different ages; Disabled people; EOG signal; Low cost hardware; Motor disability; Motor systems; Oculomotor systems; Serious games

After the full reading and quality assessment of the papers, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of the studies reported high levels of compliance, motivation, and engagement with game-based interventions both at home and at the clinical setting intervention. Regarding the effectiveness of the use of games, the results of the studies show both positive and negative results regarding their effectiveness. The efficacy was reported to motor function (i.e., improvements in the arm function, hand coordination, functional mobility, balance and gait function, postural control, upper-limbs function) and physical activity. Findings of this review suggest that games are used as a complement to conventional therapies and not as a substitute. Practitioners often struggle to get their patients to complete the assigned homework tasks, as patients display low motivation to engage in prescribed exercises. Data of this review indicates the use of games as tools suited to promote patients' engagement in the therapy and potentiate therapeutic gains. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cerebral Palsy; Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Systematic Review; Videogames,

This often deters an individual from effective execution of different Gross Motor and Fine Motor tasks as part of activities of daily living (ADL). Conventional rehabilitation methods, though powerful, require one-To-one supervision over repeated exposures. This becomes a bottleneck given limited availability of healthcare resources. Thus investigators are exploring the use of alternate technology-Assisted platforms. However, the currently existing technology-Assisted platforms are limited in individualization. Specifically, these are not adaptive to one's individualized performance capability. To bridge this gap, in our present study, we have designed a Virtual Reality (VR) based environment integrated with Data-glove for training patients with upper limb movement disorder in Gross Motor and Fine Motor tasks. Our system offered tasks of varying challenges based on one's individualized performance. The preliminary results of a usability study carried out with few healthy and post-stroke hemiplegic participants are promising. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Dataglove; Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Stroke; Upper Limb; Virtual Reality; Patient Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Virtual Reality; Activities Of Daily Living; Dataglove; Healthcare Resources; Neurological Disorders; Performance Capability; Rehabilitation Methods; Stroke; Upper Limbs; Bridges,Patient rehabilitation; Serious games; Virtual reality; Activities of Daily Living; Dataglove; Healthcare resources; Neurological disorders; Performance capability; Rehabilitation methods; stroke; Upper limbs; Bridges

KiNEEt is a system which has been developed with the major aim of improving physical and cognitive skills in students with special needs. The different activities in KiNEEt are configurable and the tutor can modify the settings according to the needs of the student. The activities are game-oriented to attract the students attention and motivate them to learn. KiNEEt is highly interactive and it will encourage the students to be active learners.

In this paper, an immersive VR rehabilitation training system endowed with wearable haptics is proposed for children with neuromotor impairments: it aims to enhance involvement and engagement of patients, to provide congruent multi-sensory afferent feedback during motor exercises and to benefit from the flexibility of VR in adapting exercises to the patient's need. An experimental rehabilitation session conducted with children with cerebral palsy (CP) and developmental dyspraxia (DD) has been performed to evaluate the usability of the system and proof of concept trial of the proposed approach. We compared CP/DD performance with both typically developing children and adult control group. Results show the system was compliant with different levels of motor skills and allowed patients to complete the experimental rehabilitation session, with performance varying according to the expected motor abilities of different groups. Moreover, a kinematic assessmentbased on the presented system has been designed. Obtained results reflected different motor abilities of patients and participants, suggesting suitability of the proposed kinematic assessment as a motor function outcome. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assistive Technologies; Children With Neuromotor Impairments; Haptic Devices; Serious Games; Virtual Reality; Wearable Robotics; E-learning; Kinematics; Serious Games; Virtual Reality; Wearable Technology; Assistive Technology; Children With Cerebral Palsies; Clinical Practices; Haptic Devices; Immersive Virtual Reality; Neuromotor; Rehabilitation Training; Wearable Robotics; Patient Rehabilitation; Accuracy; Adolescent; Apraxia; Article; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Clinical Article; Clinical Assessment; Controlled Study; Human; Kinematics; Kinesiology; Motor Dysfunction; Motor Dysfunction Assessment; Motor Performance; Neuropathy; Neurorehabilitation; Nine Hole Peg Test; Training; Virtual Reality; Biomechanics; Computer Interface; Electronic Device; Female; Game; Hereditary Motor Sensory Neuropathy; Male; Normal Human; Preschool Child; Psychomotor Performance; Self Help Device; Sensory Feedback; Adolescent; Apraxias; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Child, Preschool; Feedback, Sensory; Female; Games, Experimental; Healthy Volunteers; Hereditary Sensory And Motor Neuropathy; Humans; Male; Motor Skills; Psychomotor Performance; Self-help Devices; User-computer Interface; Virtual Reality; Wearable Electronic Devices","E-learning; Kinematics; Serious games; Virtual reality; Wearable technology; Assistive technology; Children with cerebral palsies; Clinical practices; Haptic devices; Immersive virtual reality; Neuromotor; Rehabilitation training; Wearable robotics; Patient rehabilitation; accuracy; adolescent; apraxia; Article; cerebral palsy; child; clinical article; clinical assessment; controlled study; human; kinematics; kinesiology; motor dysfunction; motor dysfunction assessment; motor performance; neuropathy; neurorehabilitation; Nine Hole Peg Test; training; virtual reality; biomechanics; computer interface; electronic device; female; game; hereditary motor sensory neuropathy; male; normal human; preschool child; psychomotor performance; self help device; sensory feedback; Adolescent; Apraxias; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Child, Preschool; Feedback, Sensory; Female; Games, Experimental; Healthy Volunteers; Hereditary Sensory and Motor Neuropathy; Humans; Male; Motor Skills; Psychomotor Performance; Self-Help Devices; User-Computer Interface; Virtual Reality; Wearable Electronic Devices"

The perspective presented here is regarded as patient centric and relies on ICTs, in order to address evidence–based treatment and care, meeting every individual's health profile, with regard to his or her needs, preferences, goals and culture. Patient-centric ICTs based approach has an impact on healthcare systems, introducing a multi-disciplinary care planning that overcomes individual, professional and organizational barriers, reduces anxiety and establishes better understanding with the student at the center. Generally, results show the impact of the interoperability of healthcare information between patients’ healthcare record and information systems which facilitate healthcare systems to be lifesaving if available at the time of medical examination. When medical treatment is combined with ICTs based methods and applications such as Serious Games, Mobile Assistive Technologies applications, Telehealth Systems and Virtual Training, patients with learning, physical and/or sensory disabilities can benefit from a cost-effective and flexible network model while having their customized needs fully examined and resolved. The articles presented within this review demonstrate that ICTs based patient-centeredness for students with learning, physical and/or sensory disabilities is associated with better (functional) outcomes leading to quality of life and inclusion, improved quality of care, fewer problem behaviors, higher levels of health-related autonomy and greater patient satisfaction. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Healthcare Systems; Icts; Learning Disabilities; Patient-centric; Physical Disabilities; Sensory Disabilities; Cost Effectiveness; Diagnosis; Interoperability; Medical Information Systems; Patient Treatment; Serious Games; Students; Health-care System; Icts; Learning Disabilities; Patient-centric; Physical Disability; Sensory Disabilities; Medical Computing,Cost effectiveness; Diagnosis; Interoperability; Medical information systems; Patient treatment; Serious games; Students; Health-care system; ICTs; Learning disabilities; Patient-centric; Physical disability; Sensory disabilities; Medical computing

The game controlling is done with a specific 3D-printed handle and is based on an acceleration sensor. The developed activation game, which requires both cognitive and motor skills was tested with test groups in three Chinese eldercare homes. The game was played by the residents and user feedback was collected by researchers' observations and players' comments in the gaming event. The most significant finding was the positive user experience of the elderly and the experience of the game being both cognitively stimulating and supportive for player activation. The game controller handle was found to be convenient for elderly people as it supports active use of hands, which was seen important by the players. Based on the observations, the developed game also seemed to provide great potential for social interaction. However, also some challenges were noticed, related to the game controller handle and game implementation. These positive finding as well as the discovered challenges are reported in this study. As a conclusion, the results are a strong encouragement for continuing activation game development for older adults. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Activation; Cognitive Impairment; Mobile Game; Motor Impairment; Older Adults; Recreation; Self-managed Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Behavioral Research; Chemical Activation; Software Design; Cognitive Impairment; Mobile Games; Motor Impairments; Older Adults; Recreation; Self-managed; Serious Games,Behavioral research; Chemical activation; Software design; Cognitive impairment; Mobile games; Motor impairments; Older adults; recreation; Self-managed; Serious games

Materials and Methods: This study reports on qualitative findings from a study, involving seven adults (two female; mean age: 65 ± 8 years) and three adolescents (one female; mean age: 15 ± 2 years) with hemiparesis, evaluating the feasibility and clinical effectiveness of a home-based custom-designed virtual rehabilitation system over 2 months. Thematic analysis was used to analyze qualitative data from therapists' weekly telephone interview notes, research team documentation regarding issues raised during technical support interactions, and the transcript of a poststudy debriefing session involving research team members and collaborators. Results: Qualitative themes that emerged suggested that system use was associated with three key factors as follows: (1) the technology itself (e.g., characteristics of the games and their clinical implications, system accessibility, and hardware and software design); (2) communication processes (e.g., preferences and effectiveness of methods used during the study); and (3) knowledge and training of participants and therapists on the technology's use (e.g., familiarity with Facebook, time required to gain competence with the system, and need for clinical observations during remote therapy). Strategies to address these factors are proposed. Conclusion: Lessons learned from this study can inform future clinical and implementation research using commercial videogames and social media platforms. The capacity to track compensatory movements, clinical considerations in game selection, the provision of kinematic and treatment progress reports to participants, and effective communication and training for therapists and participants may enhance research success, system usability, and adoption. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cerebral Palsy; Hemiplegia; Serious Games; Stroke Rehabilitation; Technology Adoption; Virtual Reality; Adolescent; Aged; Cerebral Palsy; Computer Interface; Devices; Female; Home Care; Human; Invention; Male; Paresis; Physiotherapist; Procedures; Psychology; Stroke Rehabilitation; Telerehabilitation; Utilization; Video Game; Adolescent; Aged; Cerebral Palsy; Female; Home Care Services; Humans; Inventions; Male; Paresis; Physical Therapists; Stroke Rehabilitation; Telerehabilitation; User-computer Interface; Video Games,adolescent; aged; cerebral palsy; computer interface; devices; female; home care; human; invention; male; paresis; physiotherapist; procedures; psychology; stroke rehabilitation; telerehabilitation; utilization; video game; Adolescent; Aged; Cerebral Palsy; Female; Home Care Services; Humans; Inventions; Male; Paresis; Physical Therapists; Stroke Rehabilitation; Telerehabilitation; User-Computer Interface; Video Games

Consequently, the need for a common process framework for this category of software development has become increasingly evident. The goal is to guarantee that products are developed and validated by following a coherent and systematic method that leads to high-quality serious games. This paper introduces a new process framework for the development of serious games for motor rehabilitation therapy. We introduce the new model and demonstrate its application for the development of a serious game for the improvement of the balance and postural control of adults with cerebral palsy. The development of this application has been facilitated by two technological transfer contracts and is being exploited by two different organizations. According to clinical measurements, patients using the application improved from high fall risk to moderate fall risk. We believe that our development strategy can be useful not only for motor rehabilitation therapy, but also for the development of serious games in many other rehabilitation areas. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Body Equilibrium; Cerebral Palsy; Clinical Evaluation; Fall Risk Assessment; Game; Human; Long Term Care; Motivation; Motor Performance; Motor Rehabilitation; Rehabilitation Care; Kinesiotherapy; Procedures; Recreational Game; Cerebral Palsy; Exercise Therapy; Games, Recreational; Humans; Rehabilitation","Article; body equilibrium; cerebral palsy; clinical evaluation; fall risk assessment; game; human; long term care; motivation; motor performance; motor rehabilitation; rehabilitation care; kinesiotherapy; procedures; recreational game; Cerebral Palsy; Exercise Therapy; Games, Recreational; Humans; Rehabilitation"

Repetitive therapeutic exercises play a key role in upper-body rehabilitation interventions during which a therapist provides corrective feedback to a patient based on the patient's motor skill performance. Recently, an innovative system combining a serious game with an interactive robot has emerged as a powerful tool in enhancing upper-body rehabilitation and intervention outcomes. Although several studies have shown that integrating robots into physical therapy sessions can encourage engagement and improve the efficacy of the rehabilitation protocol, most studies have not directly compared outcomes when using a robot therapist versus a human therapist. The present study aims to evaluate whether a therapy intervention coupled with a robot agent is as effective as an intervention coupled with a human agent. We evaluate this effectiveness in terms of human motor performance and intrinsic motivation. A between-subject experiment was performed with twenty participants. All participants were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: 1) participants received corrective feedback from a robot agent or 2) participants received corrective feedback from a human agent. Results showed that participants in the robot therapy group improved faster than participants in the human therapy group, but the effect from the corrective feedback lasted longer in the human therapy group than the robot therapy group. The Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) survey indicated comparable results between the two groups. The experimental results provide further evidence towards supporting the efficacy of a robotic therapy coach for children with disabilities, and motivate future studies in this domain. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Assistive Technology; Rehabilitation Robotics; Robotic Playmate; Social Robot; Motivation; Patient Rehabilitation; Robotics; Robots; Serious Games; Assistive Technology; Children With Disabilities; Corrective Feedbacks; Intrinsic Motivation; Rehabilitation Protocols; Rehabilitation Robotics; Social Robots; Therapeutic Exercise; Patient Treatment,Motivation; Patient rehabilitation; Robotics; Robots; Serious games; Assistive technology; Children with disabilities; Corrective feedbacks; Intrinsic motivation; Rehabilitation protocols; Rehabilitation robotics; Social robots; Therapeutic exercise; Patient treatment

Current strategies, such as one-on-one therapy done in rehabilitation centers, have limitations such as treatment frequency and intensity, cost and requirement of mobility. Thus, a promising strategy is home-based therapy that includes task specific exercises. However, traditional rehabilitation tasks may frustrate the patient due to their repetitive nature and may result in lack of motivation and poor rehabilitation. In this article, we propose the design and verification of an effective upper extremity rehabilitation game with a tangible robotic platform named Cellulo as a novel solution to these issues. We first describe the process of determining the design rationales to tune speed, accuracy and challenge. Then we detail our iterative participatory design process and test sessions conducted with the help of stroke, brachial plexus and cerebral palsy patients (18 in total) and 7 therapists in 4 different therapy centers. We present the initial quantitative results, which support several aspects of our design rationales and conclude with our future study plans. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Gamified Rehabilitation; Haptic Interfaces; Human-robot Interaction; Iterative Design; Rehabilitation Robotics; Tangible Robots; Haptic Interfaces; Machine Design; Man Machine Systems; Patient Rehabilitation; Patient Treatment; Robotics; Design Rationale; Iterative Design; Participatory Design; Quantitative Result; Rehabilitation Robotics; Robotic Platforms; Upper Extremity Rehabilitations; Upper-limb Rehabilitation; Human Robot Interaction,Haptic interfaces; Machine design; Man machine systems; Patient rehabilitation; Patient treatment; Robotics; Design rationale; Iterative design; Participatory design; Quantitative result; Rehabilitation robotics; Robotic platforms; Upper extremity rehabilitations; Upper-limb rehabilitation; Human robot interaction

Ninety-two per cent of the selected articles were published since 2010. This review documents 35 different gaming platforms types. Twenty-one of the 38 articles included in this review conducted a clinical trial and of those only eight report improvements in the target population following the use of the games and platforms. This review concludes that a new paradigm is emerging in the rehabilitation field, characterized by the systematic use of technological gaming platforms with serious games in/for rehabilitation. The use of this approach seems to be beneficial. However, to facilitate the full integration of these platforms, it is necessary to conduct more research in this area, explore new approaches and carry out in-depth clinical studies into the benefits of these platforms.Implications for rehabilitation This review states that the use serious games and gaming platforms for upper limb rehabilitation are starting a new paradigm in the rehabilitation.

This approach is used to improve the quality of the game experience and to avoid boredom or frustration for players with severe limitations imposed by pathologies such as stroke, cerebral palsy, and spinal cord injuries. The first EA solves the game adjustment problem, changing the game difficulty according to the player’s skill, and the purpose of the second EA is to adjust the coefficients of the first EA’s objective function so that it can work in a more effective way. To do so, the second EA uses results of game matches against simulated player profiles. The results shows that the presented method was able to identify a set of coefficients that allows the first EA to correctly adjust the difficulty level for all six tested player profiles. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Artificial Intelligence; Evolutionary Algorithms; Rehabilitation Robotics; Serious Games; Artificial Intelligence; Evolutionary Algorithms; Robotics; Cerebral Palsy; Evolutionary Algorithms (eas); Game Experience; Gaming Experiences; Objective Functions; Rehabilitation Robotics; Spinal Cord Injuries (sci); User Experience; Serious Games,Artificial intelligence; Evolutionary algorithms; Robotics; Cerebral palsy; Evolutionary algorithms (EAs); Game experience; Gaming experiences; Objective functions; Rehabilitation robotics; Spinal cord injuries (SCI); User experience; Serious games

This solution, takes advantage of a statistical method built upon the results of the specific cerebral palsy (CP) player under study, inspired from normal distribution. It is appropriate for CPs, since it favors a content-based approach which is formed upon each player’s personal results. Using a population of 20 CP patients trying to achieve the goals of games, we arrived to an 85% correlation between number of goal achievement failures and our introduced difficulty function. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cerebral Palsy; Difficulty Degree; Exergame; Diseases; Normal Distribution; Cerebral Palsy; Content-based Approach; Difficulty Degree; Exergame; Exergames; Goal Achievements; Serious Games,Diseases; Normal distribution; Cerebral palsy; Content-based approach; Difficulty degree; Exergame; Exergames; Goal achievements; Serious games

There are a few commercially available and affordable sensors. Among them, Kinect is an important asset to the concept of Natural User Interfaces, which is gaining a wider space and great importance in gaming for therapy approaches. These solutions can create therapy environments that increase the motivation of patients to achieve successful completion of rehabilitation programs that can be very demanding. However, therapists still demand customisable tools towards particular groups of patients. This paper presents “just Physio kidding”, which is a solution based on the use of serious games, natural user interfaces and personalisation to address both physiotherapy and cognitive stimulation therapy. Initially, it was designed for stroke patients and older adults on wheelchairs, then it was adapted to children with special needs.

Serious games is a category of video games that allows to educate in different areas through fun. They have become an important support tool in the learning process. However, most serious games do not focus on vulnerable groups such as people with motor impairments. On the other hand, the number of mobile serious games has increased with the use of mobile devices. Despite this, accessibility for people with motor impairments has not yet been considered a necessary feature in the development of this type of video games. Some video game developer groups recommend general accessibility guidelines for the design of such applications. However, it has become necessary to formalize, consolidate and analyze these initiatives in order to define a model for evaluating the accessibility of video games for people with motor impairments. This paper presents a compilation and analysis of accessibility guidelines for the development of video games for people with motor impairments. It also proposes a categorization of existing guidelines that allow to evaluate a video game accessibility level. As a case study, these accessibility guidelines are used to assess some mobile serious games and identify their accessibility level for people with motor impairments. We propose an assessment tool for those who wish to develop accessible serious games for people with motor impairments on mobile devices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Accessibility Assessment; Accessibility Guidelines; Mobile Devices; Motor Disabilities; Motor Impairments; Serious Games; Computer Games; Human Computer Interaction; Interactive Computer Graphics; Mobile Devices; Product Design; Accessibility Assessment; Accessibility Guidelines; Assessment Tool; Design Of Product; Learning Process; Motor Disability; Motor Impairments; Vulnerable Groups; Serious Games,Computer games; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Mobile devices; Product design; Accessibility assessment; Accessibility guidelines; Assessment tool; Design of product; Learning process; Motor disability; Motor impairments; Vulnerable groups; Serious games

Access to technology can alleviate some of these limitations. Many studies have used vision-based movement capture systems to overcome problems related to discomfort and fear of wearing devices. In contrast, there has been no research assessing the behavior of vision-based movement capture systems in people with involuntary movements. In this paper, we look at the potential of the Kinect sensor as an assistive technology for people with cerebral palsy. We developed a serious game, called KiSens Números, to study the behavior of Kinect in this context and eighteen subjects with cerebral palsy used it to complete a set of sessions. The results of the experiments show that Kinect filters some of peoples involuntary movements, confirming the potential of Kinect as an assistive technology for people with motor disabilities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Accessibility; Cerebral Palsy; Kinect; Diseases; Serious Games; Accessibility; Assistive Technology; Capture System; Cerebral Palsy; Involuntary Movements; Kinect; Kinect Sensors; Motor Disability; Behavioral Research,Diseases; Serious games; Accessibility; Assistive technology; Capture system; Cerebral palsy; Involuntary movements; Kinect; Kinect sensors; Motor disability; Behavioral research

Materials: The therapy is based on the use of the ENLAZA Interface, a head mouse based on inertial technology that will be used to control a set of serious videogames with movements of the head. Methods: Ten users with CP participated in the study. Whereas the control group (n=5) followed traditional therapies, the experimental group (n=5) complemented these therapies with a series of ten sessions of gaming with ENLAZA to exercise cervical flexion-extensions, rotations and inclinations in a controlled, engaging environment. Results: The ten work sessions yielded improvements in head and trunk control that were higher in the experimental group for Visual Analogue Scale, Goal Attainment Scaling and Trunk Control Measurement Scale (TCMS). Significant differences (27% vs. 2% of percentage improvement) were found between the experimental and control groups for TCMS (p<0.05). The kinematic assessment shows that there were some improvements in the active and the passive range of motion. However, no significant differences were found pre- and post-intervention. Conclusions:Physical therapy that combines serious games with traditional rehabilitation could allow children with CP to achieve larger function improvements in the trunk and cervical regions. However, given the limited scope of this trial (n=10) additional studies are needed to corroborate this hypothesis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cerebral Palsy; Cervical Posture; Inertial Sensors; Serious Games; Diseases; Interfaces (materials); Patient Rehabilitation; Physical Therapy; Cerebral Palsy; Cervical Posture; Children With Cerebral Palsies; Control Measurements; Goal Attainment Scaling; Inertial Sensor; Rehabilitation Therapy; Visual Analogue Scale; Serious Games; Adolescent; Adult; Article; Body Position; Cerebral Palsy; Cervical Posture; Child; Clinical Article; Controlled Study; Exercise; Female; Functional Status Assessment; Goal Attainment Scaling And Trunk Control Measurement Scale; Head Movement; Human; Informed Consent; Joint Mobilization; Kinematics; Male; Physiotherapy; Priority Journal; Range Of Motion; Video Game; Visual Analog Scale; Biomechanics; Cervical Spinal Cord; Convalescence; Pathophysiology; Preschool Child; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cerebral Palsy; Cervical Cord; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Head Movements; Humans; Male; Physical Therapy Modalities; Posture; Recovery Of Function; Video Games","Diseases; Interfaces (materials); Patient rehabilitation; Physical therapy; Cerebral palsy; Cervical posture; Children with cerebral palsies; Control measurements; Goal attainment scaling; Inertial sensor; Rehabilitation therapy; Visual analogue scale; Serious games; adolescent; adult; Article; body position; cerebral palsy; cervical posture; child; clinical article; controlled study; exercise; female; functional status assessment; Goal Attainment Scaling and Trunk Control Measurement Scale; head movement; human; informed consent; joint mobilization; kinematics; male; physiotherapy; priority journal; range of motion; video game; visual analog scale; biomechanics; cervical spinal cord; convalescence; pathophysiology; preschool child; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cerebral Palsy; Cervical Cord; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Head Movements; Humans; Male; Physical Therapy Modalities; Posture; Recovery of Function; Video Games"

One of the advantages in using this technology is the potential to create positive motivation, by means of engaging environments and tasks shaped in the form of serious games. In this work, we propose a novel Neuro Rehabilitation System for children with movement disorders, that is based on serious games in immersive virtual reality with haptic feedback. The system design aims to enhance involvement and engagement of patients, to provide congruent multi-sensory afferent feedback during motor exercises, and to benefit from the flexibility of virtual reality in adapting exercises to the patient's needs. We present a feasibility study of the method conducted through an experimental rehabilitation session in a group of 4 children with Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Dyspraxia, 4 Typically Developing children and 4 healthy adults. Subjects and patients were able to accomplish the proposed rehabilitation session and average performance of the motor exercises in patients were lower, although comparable, to healthy subjects. Together with positive comments reported by children after the rehabilitation session, results are encouraging for application of the method in a prolonged rehabilitation treatment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Diseases; Haptic Interfaces; Neuromuscular Rehabilitation; Planning; Robotics; Serious Games; Virtual Reality; Wearable Technology; Children With Cerebral Palsies; Feasibility Studies; Haptic Feedbacks; Healthy Subjects; Immersive Virtual Reality; Movement Disorders; Neurorehabilitation; Virtual-reality Environment; Patient Rehabilitation; Adolescent; Child; Electronic Device; Equipment Design; Feasibility Study; Female; Human; Male; Motor Dysfunction; Pathophysiology; Physiology; Task Performance; Touch; Video Game; Adolescent; Child; Equipment Design; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Movement Disorders; Task Performance And Analysis; Touch; Video Games; Wearable Electronic Devices,Diseases; Haptic interfaces; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Planning; Robotics; Serious games; Virtual reality; Wearable technology; Children with cerebral palsies; Feasibility studies; Haptic feedbacks; Healthy subjects; Immersive virtual reality; Movement disorders; Neurorehabilitation; Virtual-reality environment; Patient rehabilitation; adolescent; child; electronic device; equipment design; feasibility study; female; human; male; motor dysfunction; pathophysiology; physiology; task performance; touch; video game; Adolescent; Child; Equipment Design; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Movement Disorders; Task Performance and Analysis; Touch; Video Games; Wearable Electronic Devices

The current work presents ReHabGame, a serious game using a fusion of implemented technologies that can be easily used by patients and therapists to assess and enhance sensorimotor performance and also increase the activities in the daily lives of patients. The game allows a player to control avatar movements through a Kinect Xbox, Myo armband and rudder foot pedal, and involves a series of reach-grasp-collect tasks whose difficulty levels are learnt by a fuzzy interface. The orientation, angular velocity, head and spine tilts and other data generated by the player are monitored and saved, whilst the task completion is calculated by solving an inverse kinematics algorithm which orientates the upper limb joints of the avatar. The different values in upper body quantities of movement provide fuzzy input from which crisp output is determined and used to generate an appropriate subsequent rehabilitation game level. The system can thus provide personalised, autonomously-learnt rehabilitation programmes for patients with neuromuscular disorders with superior predictions to guide the development of improved clinical protocols compared to traditional theraputic activities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Fuzzy Logic; Human Computer Interaction; Industrial Electronics; Interactive Computer Graphics; Inverse Kinematics; Patient Treatment; Serious Games; Clinical Protocols; Fuzzy Interface; Inverse Kinematics Algorithms; Motor Impairments; Neuromuscular Disorders; Rehabiliation; Self-organizing Fuzzy Logic Controller; Upper Bodies; Patient Rehabilitation,Fuzzy logic; Human computer interaction; Industrial electronics; Interactive computer graphics; Inverse kinematics; Patient treatment; Serious games; Clinical protocols; Fuzzy interface; Inverse kinematics algorithms; Motor impairments; Neuromuscular disorders; Rehabiliation; Self-Organizing Fuzzy Logic Controller; Upper bodies; Patient rehabilitation

The signals from signals from the load cells distributed on the level of a force platform and at the level of child's body support ropes that are tied on the cerebral palsy spider cage are acquired and wireless transmitted to a client computation platform. Thus different tests can be carried out including, center of forces measurements and gait simulations. These tests can be study of children balance during different activities such as serious game playing for upper limb rehabilitation.

One of the most common causes of mobility impairments in children is Cerebral Palsy; it affects 3.1 of 1000 of those born in the US annually. Thus, the development of effective therapies is of significant interest, especially for this target population. Prior research has validated that early intervention enhances the individual's quality of life. A recent innovative approach to upper-body rehabilitation therapy is SuperPop VR™, a virtual reality serious game shown to increase motivation and performance in children during physical therapy sessions. Previously, a humanoid robotic playmate, the DARwIn-OP, was used to interact with users during game sessions as a socially interactive therapy coach. The goal of the study in this paper is to determine whether appearance matters - i.e. if a different robotic platform is utilized as a therapy coach, will there be a difference in user performance? The kinematic parameter of movement time is used in this analysis. We also analyzed user intrinsic motivation with and without the humanoid robot. The results show that no statistical difference was found in user performance across platforms, thus indicating that socially interaction versus appearance is the primary criteria for enhancing rehabilitation goals when integrating a robot with SuperPop VR. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Humanoid; Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Social Robot; Anthropomorphic Robots; Motivation; Patient Rehabilitation; Virtual Reality; Cerebral Palsy; Early Intervention; Effective Therapy; Humanoid; Humanoid Robot; Neurological Disorders; Quality Of Life; Social Robots; Upper Bodies; User Performance; Serious Games,Anthropomorphic robots; Motivation; Patient rehabilitation; Virtual reality; Cerebral palsy; Early intervention; Effective therapy; Humanoid; Humanoid robot; Neurological disorders; Quality of life; Social robots; Upper bodies; User performance; Serious games

Improving fine motor skills usually involves the synchronization of wrists and fingers by performing appropriate tasks and activities. This demo introduces a novel patient-centered framework for the gamification of hand therapies in order to facilitate and encourage the rehabilitation process. This framework consists of an adaptive therapy-driven 3D environment augmented with our motion-based natural user interface. An intelligent game generator is developed, which translates the patient's gestures into navigational movements with therapy-driven goals, while adapting the level of difficulty based on the patient profile and real-time performance. A comprehensive evaluation and clinical-based assessments were conducted in a local children disability center, and highlights of the results are presented.

It attempts to meet the requirements of in-home training by taking advantage of the combination of portable accelerometers (ACC) and surface electromyography (SEMG) sensors worn on the upper limb to capture functional movements. In the proposed system, the EMG-ACC acquisition device works essentially as wireless game controller, and three rehabilitation games were designed for improving upper limb motor function under a clinician's guidance. The games were developed on the Android platform based on a physical engine called Box2D. The results of a system performance test demonstrated that the developed games can respond to the upper limb actions within 210 ms. Positive questionnaire feedbacks from twenty CP subjects who participated in the game test verified both the feasibility and usability of the system. Results of a long-term game training conducted with three CP subjects demonstrated that CP patients could improve in their game performance through repetitive training, and persistent training was needed to improve and enhance the rehabilitation effect. According to our experimental results, the novel multi-feedback SEMG-ACC-based user interface improved the users' initiative and performance in rehabilitation training. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accelerometer; Android; Cerebral Palsy; Electromyography; Rehabilitation; Accelerometers; Android (operating System); Diseases; Electromyography; Neuromuscular Rehabilitation; User Interfaces; Android; Cerebral Palsy; Children With Cerebral Palsies; Functional Movements; Rehabilitation Effects; Rehabilitation Training; Surface Electromyography; Upper-limb Rehabilitation; Patient Rehabilitation; Accelerometer; Article; Cerebral Palsy; Clinical Article; Cognition; Elbow; Electrode; Electromyography; Fatigue; Female; Human; Information Processing; Male; Motor Dysfunction; Motor Performance; Muscle Contraction; Program Feasibility; Questionnaire; Response Time; Training; Upper Limb; Video Game; Wrist; Accelerometry; Child; Clinical Trial; Computer Assisted Therapy; Device Failure Analysis; Devices; Equipment Design; Kinesiotherapy; Neurorehabilitation; Patient Satisfaction; Procedures; Reproducibility; Sensitivity And Specificity; Treatment Outcome; Accelerometry; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Exercise Therapy; Female; Humans; Male; Neurological Rehabilitation; Patient Satisfaction; Reproducibility Of Results; Sensitivity And Specificity; Therapy, Computer-assisted; Treatment Outcome; Upper Extremity; Video Games","Accelerometers; Android (operating system); Diseases; Electromyography; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; User interfaces; android; Cerebral palsy; Children with cerebral palsies; Functional movements; Rehabilitation effects; Rehabilitation training; Surface electromyography; Upper-limb rehabilitation; Patient rehabilitation; accelerometer; Article; cerebral palsy; clinical article; cognition; elbow; electrode; electromyography; fatigue; female; human; information processing; male; motor dysfunction; motor performance; muscle contraction; program feasibility; questionnaire; response time; training; upper limb; video game; wrist; accelerometry; child; clinical trial; computer assisted therapy; device failure analysis; devices; equipment design; kinesiotherapy; neurorehabilitation; patient satisfaction; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; treatment outcome; Accelerometry; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Exercise Therapy; Female; Humans; Male; Neurological Rehabilitation; Patient Satisfaction; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Therapy, Computer-Assisted; Treatment Outcome; Upper Extremity; Video Games"

Among these ones impaired balance and posture are very common. Traditional physical therapy exercise programs are focusing on this aspect, but it is difficult to motivate patients to regularly perform these exercises, especially at home without therapist supervision. Specially developed serious games (SG) could therefore be an interesting option to motivate children to perform specific exercise for balance improvement. Method: Ten CP children participated in this study. Patients received four sessions of SG included into conventional therapy (1 session of 30 min a week during 4 weeks). Trunk control and balance were assessed using Trunk Control Motor Scale (TCMS) before and after interventions. Results: Children presented a significant improvement in TCMS global score after interventions [37.6 (8.7) and 39.6 (9.5) before and after interventions, respectively, p = 0.04]. Conclusion: SG could therefore be an interesting option to integrate in the conventional treatment of CP children.Implication for Rehabilitation Cerebral palsy (CP) leads to balance issues. Rehabilitation exercises are not performed (enough) at home. Serious games (SG) could increase patients’ motivation. SG increase balance control of CP children. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cerebral Palsy; Exercise; Motor Control; New Technology; Posture; Rehabilitation; Body Equilibrium; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Female; Human; Kinesiotherapy; Male; Muscle Weakness; Physiotherapy; Procedures; Spasticity; Treatment Outcome; Video Game; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Exercise Therapy; Female; Humans; Male; Muscle Spasticity; Muscle Weakness; Physical Therapy Modalities; Postural Balance; Treatment Outcome; Video Games,body equilibrium; cerebral palsy; child; female; human; kinesiotherapy; male; muscle weakness; physiotherapy; procedures; spasticity; treatment outcome; video game; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Exercise Therapy; Female; Humans; Male; Muscle Spasticity; Muscle Weakness; Physical Therapy Modalities; Postural Balance; Treatment Outcome; Video Games

The primary (but not exclusive) purpose is to increase the motivation of children and adolescents with severe physical impairments, for doing their required exercises while playing. The proposed gaming environment is based on the Kinect sensor and the Blender Game Engine. A middleware has been implemented that efficiently transmits the data from the sensor to the game. Inside the game, different newly proposed mechanisms have been developed to distinguish pure exercise-gestures from other movements used to control the game (e.g., opening a menu). The main contribution is the amplification of weak movements, which allows the physically impaired to have similar gaming experiences as the average population. To test the feasibility of the proposed methods, four mini-games were implemented and tested by a group of 11 volunteers with different disabilities, most of them bound to a wheelchair. Their performance has also been compared to that of a healthy control group. Results are generally positive and motivating, although there is much to do to improve the functionalities. There is a major demand for applications that help to include disabled people in society and to improve their life conditions. This work will contribute towards providing them with more fun during exercise. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Adaptation; Adolescents; Children; Exergames; Gamification; Kinect; Middleware; Muscle Weakness; Physical Disability; Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Blending; Middleware; Motivation; Patient Rehabilitation; Adaptation; Adolescents; Children; Exergames; Gamification; Kinect; Muscle Weakness; Physical Disability; Serious Games; Adolescent; Exercise; Human; Kinesiotherapy; Motivation; Motor Dysfunction; Movement (physiology); Video Game; Adolescent; Exercise; Exercise Therapy; Humans; Motor Disorders; Movement; Video Games,Blending; Middleware; Motivation; Patient rehabilitation; Adaptation; Adolescents; Children; Exergames; Gamification; Kinect; Muscle weakness; Physical disability; Serious games; adolescent; exercise; human; kinesiotherapy; motivation; motor dysfunction; movement (physiology); video game; Adolescent; Exercise; Exercise Therapy; Humans; Motor Disorders; Movement; Video Games

This chapter provides a summary of previous studies that incorporated computer games for CP rehabilitation. Moreover, a comprehensive game-based rehabilitation framework is presented to enable CP children to actively participate in upper-limb physical exercises. The framework design is based on five features that aim to achieve enjoyable and effective game-based physical exercises for complementing conventional CP rehabilitation. A prototype implementation of the framework is developed, which includes three Kinect-based games that target upper-limb excesses. The prototype implementation was employed in the rehabilitation of three CP patients, and the preliminary results suggest the feasibility of the framework for complementary CP rehabilitation.

Participants identify a list of marine animals using figure recognition techniques. Fun Ocean allows participants to interact with the iPad via finger touch and shaking the G sensor device to transfer marine animals from one iPad to another, which motivates them to learn about the defensive and offensive functions of marine animals. Participants' game behavior change on each trial was collected throughout the experiment via observation with a checklist. It was found that Fun Ocean improved the cognitive skills of the students with special needs, and enhanced their learning interest and attentiveness.

The main objectives of the motor rehabilitation are to reduce disability, increase functional ability and, consequently, promote social participation. Adapted peripherals were specially developed for users with motor impairments to enable them the access to the adapted rehabilitation games. The peripherals are based on inertial sensors and superficial electromyography for the measurement of body posture and muscle activation. In addition, a gaze tracking device will quantify the child’s level of attention during the game. The system will allow the therapist to design and import customized rehabilitation protocols consisting of sequences of games to exercise 3 body segments (head, trunk, and upper limbs) and perform movements in the frontal, sagittal and transverse axis. The therapist will be able to select specific difficulty levels for each subject and stage of the therapy and to monitor the evolution of the child throughout the work sessions.

The research group of the authors has already proposed a component-based three-dimensional (3D) software development system called IntelligentBox. One of the application fields of IntelligentBox is the development of 3D games. In this article, the authors validate the availability of IntelligentBox for the prototype development of Tai Chi-based physical therapy games that require several functionalities, for example, body action input, sound play, movie play, and so on. For them, IntelligentBox has already supported a video-based motion input, a motion capture system input, a data-glove input, and so on. Also, physical therapy games need fine-tuning, according to each of the rehabilitants, because their physical disability levels differ. Therefore, therapists have to frequently change many parameters such as a body action speed, difficulty levels of body actions, and so on. For this point, the component-based approach is significant. To validate this, the authors have been developing physical therapy games using IntelligentBox and they have just developed a practical Tai Chi-based dance game as one of the physical therapy games. In this article, the authors explain how easily such a game can be developed using IntelligentBox. The authors also explain new functionalities of several components of IntelligentBox extended for this development. In addition, this article shows the results of the performance evaluations to indicate that the developed game practically can be used as a physical therapy game.

In this context, a difficulty adjustment system is proposed that takes user performance as input and generates two different responses: a) a change in the distance the user should cover, and b) the velocity provided to the target. User performance is estimated from its ability to achieve the targets (game score) performing movements. The system interference in user displacement value and target speed where chosen to stimulate the user to achieve specific rehabilitation goals. The game difficulty adjustment has received small attention in the context of rehabilitation robotics interfaces. It is important to note that games developed for rehabilitation differ from commercial entertainment games due to severe limitations imposed to patients by pathologies like stroke, cerebral palsy and spinal cord injury. An Evolutionary Algorithm (AE) based optimization strategy was adopted to adjust game's difficulty. A meta-profile for user behavior was also developed allowing to create and simulate different virtual users and game experiences in computer. This user profile includes a reaction time (time delay), motion disturbance and a kinematical motion profile based on a polynomial function. Using the meta-profile, different user motion behavior can be generated for exhaustive test and optimization of the difficulty adjustment system. The approach allows the reduction of development time and also the reduction in the number of experiments with volunteers. The computer simulation test results are presented to demonstrate the capacity of the difficulty adjustment system to adapt the game characteristics to the users' abilities with different skills levels. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Behavioral Research; Computer Games; Evolutionary Algorithms; Optimization; Robotics; Time Delay; Development Time; Displacement Value; Exhaustive Tests; Optimization Strategy; Polynomial Functions; Rehabilitation Robotics; Spinal Cord Injuries (sci); User Performance; Patient Rehabilitation,Behavioral research; Computer games; Evolutionary algorithms; Optimization; Robotics; Time delay; Development time; Displacement value; Exhaustive tests; Optimization strategy; Polynomial functions; Rehabilitation robotics; Spinal cord injuries (SCI); User performance; Patient rehabilitation

[Subjects and Methods] This study demonstrates the results of using therapeutic games in patients with infantile cerebral palsy. The therapies were performed in 30-minute sessions for about 1 to 4 months. This study shows the progress of five children with cerebral palsy during the sessions. The time it took the children on each road and the times required to complete a task were measured. In addition, the level of difficulty of the games was gradually increased at each session. [Results] Results have shown good progress on the accuracy of the movements and an increase in concentration level during the execution of the games, showing an improvement in the patients’ performance by 40–55% faster. [Conclusions] Health games encourage children to comply with therapy. The advantage of the game is that the patient can perform the therapy at home, which could help achieve further progress in patients. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Computer Games; Infantile Cerebral Palsy; Rehabilitation Games,

Outcomes were children's preference for single player or dual player mode, and changes in arm activity and kinematics. Method: Nine boys and two girls with cerebral palsy (6-12 years, mean 9 years) played assistive technology computer games in single-user mode or with school friends in an AB-BA design. Preference was determined by recording the time spent playing each mode and by qualitative feedback. We used the ABILHAND-kids and Canadian Occupational Performance Measure to evaluate activity limitation, and a portable laptop-based device to capture arm kinematics. Results: No difference was recorded between single-user and dual-user modes (median daily use 9.27 versus 11.2 min, p = 0.214). Children reported dual-user mode was preferable. There were no changes in activity limitation (ABILHAND-kids, p = 0.424; COPM, p = 0.484) but we found significant improvements in hand speed (p = 0.028), smoothness (p = 0.005) and accuracy (p = 0.007). Conclusion: School timetables prohibit extensive use of rehabilitation technology but there is potential for its short-term use to supplement a rehabilitation program. The restricted access to the rehabilitation games was sufficient to improve arm kinematics but not arm activity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Assistive Technology; Cerebral Palsy; Children; Computer Games; Robotics; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Computer Interface; Female; Human; Male; Robotics; Upper Limb; Video Game; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Robotics; Upper Extremity; User-computer Interface; Video Games,cerebral palsy; child; computer interface; female; human; male; robotics; upper limb; video game; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Robotics; Upper Extremity; User-Computer Interface; Video Games

On the one hand, new and useful treatment tools such as rehabilitation systems based on interactive technologies have appeared for rehabilitation of gross motor movements. On the other hand, from the therapeutic point of view, performing rehabilitation exercises with the facial muscles can improve the swallowing process, the facial expression through the management of muscles in the face, and even the speech of children with cerebral palsy. However, it is difficult to find interactive games to improve the detection and evaluation of oral-facial musculature dysfunctions in children with CP. This paper describes a framework based on strategies developed for interactive serious games that is created both for typically developed children and children with disabilities. Four interactive games are the core of a Virtual Environment called SONRIE. This paper demonstrates the benefits of SONRIE to monitor children’s oral-facial difficulties. The next steps will focus on the validation of SONRIE to carry out the rehabilitation process of oral-facial musculature in children with cerebral palsy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Detection; Inclusive Education; Serious Games; Virtual Reality; Virtual Therapeutic Environment; Diseases; Error Detection; Face Recognition; Muscle; Virtual Reality; Children With Cerebral Palsies; Children With Disabilities; Inclusive Education; Interactive Technology; Rehabilitation Exercise; Rehabilitation System; Serious Games; Virtual Therapeutic Environment; Patient Rehabilitation; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Computer Interface; Face Muscle; Human; Kinesiotherapy; Meta Analysis; Pathophysiology; Physiology; Procedures; Speech; Telerehabilitation; Video Game; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Exercise Therapy; Facial Muscles; Humans; Speech; Telerehabilitation; User-computer Interface; Video Games,Diseases; Error detection; Face recognition; Muscle; Virtual reality; Children with cerebral palsies; Children with disabilities; Inclusive education; Interactive technology; Rehabilitation exercise; Rehabilitation System; Serious games; Virtual therapeutic environment; Patient rehabilitation; cerebral palsy; child; computer interface; face muscle; human; kinesiotherapy; meta analysis; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; speech; telerehabilitation; video game; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Exercise Therapy; Facial Muscles; Humans; Speech; Telerehabilitation; User-Computer Interface; Video Games

The search was limited to peer-reviewed English journals. The beginning of the search time frame was not restricted and the end of the search time frame was 31 December 2015. Only randomized controlled trial, cohort, and observational studies evaluating the effect of VGs on physical rehabilitation were included in the review. A total of 4728 abstracts were screened, 275 were fully reviewed, and 126 papers were eventually included. The following information was extracted from the selected studies: device type, number and type of patients, intervention, and main outcomes. The integration of VGs into physical rehabilitation has been tested for various pathological conditions, including stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease, balance training, weight loss, and aging. There was large variability in the protocols used (e.g. number of sessions, intervention duration, outcome measures, and sample size). The results of this review show that in most cases, the introduction of VG training in physical rehabilitation offered similar results as conventional therapy. Therefore, VGs could be added as an adjunct treatment in rehabilitation for various pathologies to stimulate patient motivation. VGs could also be used at home to maintain rehabilitation benefits. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Keywords: Exercises; Motivation; New Technology; Rehabilitation; Human Computer Interaction; Interactive Computer Graphics; Patient Treatment; Balance Training; Commercial Video; Observational Study; Outcome Measures; Pathological Conditions; Physical Rehabilitation; Randomized Controlled Trial; Systematic Review; Patient Rehabilitation; Body Equilibrium; Cerebral Palsy; Cohort Analysis; Female; Human; Multimodality Cancer Therapy; Observational Study; Outcome Assessment; Parkinson Disease; Physiotherapy; Procedures; Psychomotor Disorders; Randomized Controlled Trial (topic); Stroke Rehabilitation; Video Game; Cerebral Palsy; Cohort Studies; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Humans; Observational Studies As Topic; Outcome Assessment (health Care); Parkinson Disease; Physical Therapy Modalities; Postural Balance; Randomized Controlled Trials As Topic; Stroke Rehabilitation; Video Games,Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Patient treatment; Balance training; Commercial video; Observational study; Outcome measures; Pathological conditions; Physical rehabilitation; Randomized controlled trial; Systematic Review; Patient rehabilitation; body equilibrium; cerebral palsy; cohort analysis; female; human; multimodality cancer therapy; observational study; outcome assessment; Parkinson disease; physiotherapy; procedures; Psychomotor Disorders; randomized controlled trial (topic); stroke rehabilitation; video game; Cerebral Palsy; Cohort Studies; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Humans; Observational Studies as Topic; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Parkinson Disease; Physical Therapy Modalities; Postural Balance; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Stroke Rehabilitation; Video Games

The therapy is based on the use of an inertial sensor that will be used to control a set of serious videogames with movements of the head. Ten users with CP participated in the study, in the experimental and control groups. Ten sessions of therapy provided improvements in head and trunk control that were higher in the experimental group for Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) and Trunk Control Measurement Scale (TCMS). Significant differences (27% vs. 2% of percentage improvement) were found between the experimental and control groups for TCMS (p < 0.05). The kinematic assessment shows that there are some improvements in active and passive range of motion, but no significant differences were found pre-and after-therapy. This new strategy, together with traditional rehabilitation therapies, could allow the child to reach maximum levels of function in the trunk and cervical regions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cerebral Palsy; Cervical Posture; Inertial Sensor; Serious Games; Bioinformatics; Biomedical Engineering; Diseases; Inertial Navigation Systems; Cerebral Palsy; Cervical Posture; Children With Cerebral Palsies; Goal Attainment Scaling; Inertial Sensor; Rehabilitation Therapy; Serious Games; Visual Analogue Scale; Patient Rehabilitation,Bioinformatics; Biomedical engineering; Diseases; Inertial navigation systems; Cerebral palsy; Cervical posture; Children with cerebral palsies; Goal attainment scaling; Inertial sensor; Rehabilitation therapy; Serious games; Visual analogue scale; Patient rehabilitation

Indeed the integration of serious games in rehabilitation has been tested for various pathologies (e.g. brain stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease... ). Parallel to this clinical research, a lot of studies have been done in order to validate the use of these game controllers for simple biomechanical evaluation. Currently, it is thus possible to record the motions performed by the patients during serious gaming exercises for later analysis. Therefore, data collected during the exercises could be used for monitoring the evolution of the patients during long term rehabilitation. Before using the parameters extracted from the games to assess patients' evolution two important aspects must be verified: the reproducibility of measurement and a possible effect of learning of the task to be performed. To evaluate these parameters two specially developed games for physical rehabilitation were used. Ten healthy adults played 9 sessions of games over a 3 weeks period. Different parameters were extracted from the games: time, range of motion, reaching area... ANOVA and ICC were processed to evaluate reproducibility of measurement. The majority of the learning effect occurred during the very first session. Therefore, in order to allow regular monitoring the results of this first session should not be included in the follow-up of the patient. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Assessement; Biomechanical Analysis; New Technology; Serious Games; Biomechanics; Brain; Human Computer Interaction; Parameter Estimation; Patient Rehabilitation; Virtual Reality; Assessement; Biomechanical Analysis; Biomechanical Evaluation; Clinical Evolutions; Clinical Research; Parkinson's Disease; Physical Rehabilitation; Reproducibilities; Serious Games,Biomechanics; Brain; Human computer interaction; Parameter estimation; Patient rehabilitation; Virtual reality; Assessement; Biomechanical analysis; Biomechanical evaluation; Clinical evolutions; Clinical research; Parkinson's disease; Physical rehabilitation; Reproducibilities; Serious games

According to the 2010 Census, in Brazil, people with physical disabilities account for almost 7% of the population. This project aims to design Digital Learning Constructs (DLC) as an inclusive education model implemented by use of Brain Computer Interface (BCI). Thus, it is intended to assist people with mobility limitations in the process of school inclusion. A DLC is any entity or device devised or built in a multidisciplinary way in the form of an educational game, helping players to build or redesign their knowledge. It has as features, dual nature, as an object of learning and also a game, working procedurally the contributions of each area without any subordination between them. Thus, via BCI, the user will not use mouse, but a specific low cost hardware, which will command the computer via brain waves. Future studies with the user will be conducted through a qualitative, quantitative and ergonomic design approach. The study subjects are people with motor and communication problems, of the municipal education network. The importance of studies linked to the autonomy of these subjects is due to the fact that many do not have freedom of movement, because of motor impairments. The aim of this project is to open paths for people with motor impairments and degenerative diseases, so they can use the computer in the classroom context. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Brain Computer Interface; Cerebral Palsy; Game; Inclusion; Brain; Computer Games; Computer Hardware; Education; Education Computing; Ergonomics; Inclusions; Interfaces (computer); Teaching; Transportation; Cerebral Palsy; Communication Problems; Degenerative Disease; Education Networks; Freedom Of Movement; Game; Inclusive Education; Physical Disability; Brain Computer Interface,Brain; Computer games; Computer hardware; Education; Education computing; Ergonomics; Inclusions; Interfaces (computer); Teaching; Transportation; Cerebral palsy; Communication problems; Degenerative disease; Education networks; Freedom of movement; Game; Inclusive education; Physical disability; Brain computer interface

In this work, we discuss the design space for BCI training games based on existing literature, and a training game in form of a Jigsaw Puzzle. The game was trialled with four cerebral palsy patients. All patients were very acceptant of the involved technology, which, we argue, relates back to the concept of BCI training games plus the adaptations we made.

A key point of the platform is that the framework can be used by personal with no specific skill in game creation, permitting caregivers and parents its utilization. The system is composed of (i) a framework that encompasses the several tools developed to run and control the games, (ii) the authoring tool to easily allows the creation of new games, and (iii) the analyzing tool that generate statistics on the impact of the games in CP patients. Due to motor and cognitive constraints of CP patients, specific sets of games were developed. Also an extensive group of peripherals can be employed beyond the usual game controllers, including color and depth cameras, Nintendo Wiimote and balance boards.

The design of these specialized virtual environments requires to meet the needs of patients and therapists, which is not a simple task. To support the design of these applications a number of re- commendations for the developers have been proposed in literature. Here, a taxonomy is proposed to classify the identified principles, criteria, implications, usability factors or guidelines on which the recommendations are based. The taxonomy identifies key factors in the design of virtual en- vironments for upper limb motor therapy. The taxonomy is organized into three categories corresponding to different stages of the therapy: configuration of the exercise, assis-Tance during the execution of the exercise and management of therapy results. We believe that agglutinating and or- ganizing design factors into a taxonomy may reduce development times, facilitate communication between developers and clinical counterparts and increase chances of therapeutic validity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Design Recommendations; Motor Therapy; Serious Games; Stroke; Virtual Environments; Human Computer Interaction; Patient Treatment; Taxonomies; Virtual Reality; Design Recommendations; Different Stages; Motor Disability; Motor Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Stroke; Stroke Survivors; Usability Factors; Patient Rehabilitation,Human computer interaction; Patient treatment; Taxonomies; Virtual reality; Design recommendations; Different stages; Motor disability; Motor rehabilitation; Serious games; Stroke; Stroke survivors; Usability factors; Patient rehabilitation

Traditional physical therapy exercise programs are focusing on this aspect but it is difficult to motivate patients to regularly perform these exercises. Specially developed serious games (SG) could therefore be an interesting option to motivate children to perform specific exercise for balance improvement. This paper presents a feasibility study including 10 CP children. Patients received 4 sessions of SG included into conventional therapy. Trunk control and balance were assessed using Trunk Control Motor Scale (TCMS) before and after intervention. Children presented a significant improvement in TCMS after interventions (37,6 (8.7) and 39.6 (9.5) before and after intervention respectively, p=0.04). SG could therefore be an interesting option to integrate in the conventional treatment of CP children. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Balance; Cerebral Palsy; Motor Control; Rehabilitation; Balancing; Diseases; Patient Rehabilitation; Patient Treatment; Planning; Balance Training; Cerebral Palsy; Clinical Signs; Conventional Treatments; Exercise Programs; Feasibility Studies; Motor Control; Spasticity; Serious Games,Balancing; Diseases; Patient rehabilitation; Patient treatment; Planning; Balance training; Cerebral palsy; Clinical signs; Conventional treatments; Exercise programs; Feasibility studies; Motor control; Spasticity; Serious games

Although mainstream active videogames typically offer children an appealing user experience, they are not designed for therapeutic relevance. Conversely, rehabilitation-specific games often struggle to provide an immersive experience that sustains interest. This study aims to design and evaluate two VR-based therapy games for upper and lower limb rehabilitation and to evaluate their efficacy with dual focus on therapeutic relevance and user experience. Materials and Methods: Three occupational therapists, three physiotherapists, and eight children (8-12 years old), with CP Level I-III on the Gross Motor Function Classification System, evaluated two games for the Microsoft® (Redmond, WA) Kinect™ for Windows and completed the System Usability Scale (SUS), Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES), and custom feedback questionnaires. Results: Children and therapists unanimously agreed on the enjoyment and therapeutic value of the games. Median scores on the PACES were high (6.24±0.95 on the 7-point scale). Therapists considered the system to be of average usability (50th percentile on the SUS). The most prevalent usability issue was detection errors distinguishing the child's movements from the supporting therapist's. The ability to adjust difficulty settings and to focus on targeted goals (e.g., elbow/shoulder extension, weight shifting) was highly valued by therapists. Conclusions: Engaging both therapists and children in a user-centered design approach enabled the development of two VR-based therapy games for upper and lower limb rehabilitation that are dually (a) engaging to the child and (b) therapeutically relevant. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,

Conventional methods are used generally for the rehabilitation of this disorder and studies are currently trying to rehabilitate patients through interaction with serious video games focused on health. This study proposes a combination of the two methods to find improvements in the flexion angle of shoulder affected by upper motor neurone lesion in patients of the ""Clinica de Dolor del Eje Cafetero"". Methodology-6 patients (3 patients with sequels of stroke, 1 patient with sequels of TBI and 2 patients with sequels of cerebral palsy) were taken into consideration. All patients suffered monoparesia in upper limb. Each patient had 7 sessions of rehabilitation. Each session of rehabilitation lasted for 30 minutes of assisted therapy and another 30 minutes with therapies of VR, where the movements of flexion of the shoulder affected through the Kinect sensor were recorded while the patient interacted with the video game. A biomechanical analysis with the Bio-Cirac software developed to load data from MoCap and show angle graphs was performed. Results- the patient who achieved the best results showed 21.0 % of improvement in the angle of flexion of the affected shoulder and improvement in muscular endurance and control of their affected limb. Conclusion- VR and serious video games specifically designed for particular pathologies are potentially useful technologies that can be combined with conventional methods to improve the angle of amplitude of flexion of the shoulder affected in patients with sequels of upper motor neurone lesion. In addition VR offers immersive experiences favorable for dissipation of pain, fatigue, setting goals and enjoyment of the activity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Exergame; Kinect; Pyramidal Syndrome; Rehabilitation; Serious Game; Health; Human Computer Interaction; Interactive Computer Graphics; Patient Treatment; Biomechanical Analysis; Conventional Methods; Exergame; Kinect; Kinect Sensors; Pyramidal Syndrome; Quality Of Life; Serious Games; Patient Rehabilitation,Health; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Patient treatment; Biomechanical analysis; Conventional methods; Exergame; Kinect; Kinect sensors; Pyramidal syndrome; Quality of life; Serious games; Patient rehabilitation

Telerehabilitation is an emerging approach that is being used for the effective treatment of multiple diseases, and is beginning to show promise for stroke. The purpose of this review is to identify and highlight the areas of telerehabilitation that require the most research attention. Recent findings Although there are many different forms of telerehabilitation approaches being attempted for stroke, the only approach that is currently showing moderate-strong evidence for efficacy is videogame-driven telerehabilitation (VGDT). However, targeted research is still required to determine the feasibility of VGDT: metrics regarding system usability, cost-effectiveness, and data privacy concerns still require major attention. Summary VGDT is an emerging approach that shows enormous promise for stroke rehabilitation. Future studies should focus less on developing custom task controllers and therapy games and more on developing innovative, online data acquisition and analytics pipelines, as well as understanding the patient population so that the rehabilitation experience can be better customized. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Physical Therapy; Stroke; Telemedicine; Telerehabilitation; Virtual Reality; Cerebrovascular Accident; Computer Language; Computer Program; Confidentiality; Cost Effectiveness Analysis; Dyskinesia; Feedback System; Human; Meta Analysis (topic); Rehabilitation Care; Rehabilitation Center; Review; Robotics; Stroke Patient; Telehealth; Telemedicine; Telemonitoring; Telerehabilitation; Videoconferencing; Virtual Reality; Computer Interface; Procedures; Recreation; Stroke; Humans; Telemedicine; User-computer Interface; Video Games,cerebrovascular accident; computer language; computer program; confidentiality; cost effectiveness analysis; dyskinesia; feedback system; human; meta analysis (topic); rehabilitation care; rehabilitation center; Review; robotics; stroke patient; telehealth; telemedicine; telemonitoring; telerehabilitation; videoconferencing; virtual reality; computer interface; procedures; recreation; Stroke; Humans; Telemedicine; User-Computer Interface; Video Games

However, the increasing affected population and the limited healthcare resources prevent the provision of intense rehabilitation care. Thus, there is a need for a more autonomous and scalable care provision methods that can be transferred out of the clinic and into home environments. Serious games in combination with robotic rehabilitation can provide an affordable, engaging, and effective way to intensify treatment, both at the clinic and at home. Furthermore, they can offer quantitative assessment of motor performance, allowing individualized treatments and to keep the patient and their therapists informed about therapy progress. Towards this end, a set of games for assessment and training of upper-limb motor impairment after stroke with the ArmAssist is presented. A special effort has been made to design the assessment games in order to be able, not only to measure the effectiveness of the training, but also to compare the assessment results with the standard assessment scales used in the clinic. Feedback from usability testing of previous versions of the system has also been crucial for the final design. Preliminary results of an ongoing clinical testing are presented. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Home-based Telerehabilitation; Motivation; Quantitative Assessment; Reach Training; Robotic Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Stroke; Upper-limb Rehabilitation; Motivation; Neuromuscular Rehabilitation; Patient Treatment; Robotics; Quantitative Assessments; Robotic Rehabilitation; Stroke; Telerehabilitation; Upper-limb Rehabilitation; Serious Games,Motivation; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Patient treatment; Robotics; Quantitative assessments; Robotic rehabilitation; Stroke; Telerehabilitation; Upper-limb rehabilitation; Serious games

This paper describes a test of a custom-made Kinect-based health game called Burnie that gamifies upper arm physical therapy for pediatric cerebral palsy patients by placing the player in the role of a bird navigating a nature-themed obstacle course. Precise repetition of the games can be a difficult learning task as the player's feedback of correct learning is kinesthetic rather than visual. This study seeks to illuminate the affective element of learning specific physical poses within a video game learning paradigm. This pilot study evaluates the game for player satisfaction along the dimensions of graphics, controls, and overall enjoyment. In preparation for later testing with the target population of pediatric patients, an initial pilot study was conducted with undergraduate students as test subjects using a post-test only control group design. After subjects played the game for fifteen minutes, they evaluated the game along the aforementioned dimensions using a pen and paper survey. Average observed ratings (on a 10 point scale, higher being better) were: 7.65, 5.4, and 6.75, respectively. These results indicate that Burnie is an enjoyable game experience, but in order to maximize effectiveness more research needs to be done on the control scheme to determine why it was rated lower than the rest of the game. Identification of the specific factors that contribute to control enjoyment is recommended. This work contributes to HCI by presenting a new method for leveraging computers to improve the quality of life of pediatric sufferers of cerebral palsy, and contributes to education by providing a new means for teaching individuals how to perform specific therapeutic gestures within a game-based learning session. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Behavior Modification; Cerebral Palsy; Kinect; Serious Games; Diseases; Engineering Education; Human Computer Interaction; Pediatrics; Physical Therapy; Students; Behavior Modifications; Cerebral Palsy; Game-based Learning; Kinect; Learning Paradigms; Player Satisfactions; Serious Games; Undergraduate Students; Computer Games,Diseases; Engineering education; Human computer interaction; Pediatrics; Physical therapy; Students; Behavior modifications; Cerebral palsy; Game-based Learning; Kinect; Learning paradigms; Player satisfactions; Serious games; Undergraduate students; Computer games

These games are embedded in off-the-shelf commercial entertainment applications or especially-developed for clinical purposes. Treatment of cerebral palsy (CP) children is a challenging task for clinicians. Lack of motivation and progress monitoring are two important factors clinicians need to deal with. The use of serious games (SG), sometimes referred to as Virtual Rehabilitation (VR), could therefore be an interesting adjuvant to conventional treatment for these patients. This is however a new discipline and many scientific issues remain to be solved. The aim of this paper is to describe available conventional treatment for CP children together with the level of evidence of each approach. A systematic review of the use of SG in rehabilitation is then conducted. 31 papers (7 randomized clinical trials, 16 cohort studies and 8 single-cases studies) were selected and analyzed, and their level of evidence compared to the conventional treatment. These studies reported outcomes for 352 patients. In summary, this review shows that it is difficult to compare those studies despite the large amount of patients. This is due to the lack of standardization in patient rehabilitation strategy and to the use of various clinical scales and scores. This non-standardization in patient follow-up between previously-published works make evidence-based conclusions difficult to obtain in order to support these techniques objectively. The use of SG for rehabilitation purposes currently meets similar issues. This paper proposes standardization strategies in order to improve treatment comparison and SG use in rehabilitation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cerebral Palsy; Neurorehabilitation; New Technology; Rehabilitation; Treatment; Baclofen; Botulinum Toxin A; Dantrolene; Gabapentin; Tiagabine; Tizanidine; Baclofen; Benzodiazepine Derivative; Botulinum Toxin A; Dantrolene; Gabapentin; Tiagabine; Tizanidine; Cerebral Palsy; Chirurgical Intervention; Conductive Education; Controlled Study; Daily Life Activity; Dorsal Rhizotomy; Exercise; Gait; Game; Human; Intermethod Comparison; Intervention Study; Neurodevelopmental Treatment; Occupational Therapy; Orthosis; Physiotherapy; Randomized Controlled Trial; Recreation; Rehabilitation; Review; Standardization; Systematic Review; Virtual Rehabilitation; Child; Motor Activity; Movement Disorders; Randomized Controlled Trial (topic); Cerebral Palsy; Child; Games, Experimental; Humans; Motor Activity; Randomized Controlled Trials As Topic; Video Games","baclofen; benzodiazepine derivative; botulinum toxin A; dantrolene; gabapentin; tiagabine; tizanidine; cerebral palsy; chirurgical intervention; conductive education; controlled study; daily life activity; dorsal rhizotomy; exercise; gait; game; human; intermethod comparison; intervention study; neurodevelopmental treatment; occupational therapy; orthosis; physiotherapy; randomized controlled trial; recreation; rehabilitation; review; standardization; systematic review; virtual rehabilitation; child; motor activity; Movement Disorders; randomized controlled trial (topic); Cerebral Palsy; Child; Games, Experimental; Humans; Motor Activity; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Video Games"

One of the reasons for this popularity is due to availability of economically priced 3D motion sensors. In this paper, we present a web-based 3D interactive serious game interface that uses non-invasive methods to recognize the movements of the body. Motion data of a subject is collected through two motion sensors, a Kinect and a LEAP, in a noninvasive manner. Joint motion along with inverse kinematic joint information is displayed in 3D environment in a live manner or recorded for offline replaying and data analysis. To facilitate the complex therapy authoring process, the system incorporates an authoring tool that allows a therapist to design a complex therapy in terms of primitive therapies and assign it to a patient. The subject as well as other members of the community of interest such as therapists, parents and caregivers can view the results at any time and can follow up with patient's progress.

This system is based on a serious game for balance rehabilitation therapy, designed using the prototype development paradigm and features for rehabilitation with serious games: feedback, adaptability, motivational elements, and monitoring. In addition, the employed interaction technology is based on computer vision because motor rehabilitation consists of body movements that can be recorded, and because vision capture technology is noninvasive and can be used for clients who have difficulties in holding physical devices. Previous research has indicated that serious games help to motivate clients in therapy sessions; however, there remains a paucity of clinical evidence involving functionality. We rigorously evaluated the effects of physiotherapy treatment on balance and gait function of adult subjects with cerebral palsy undergoing our experimental system. A 24-week physiotherapy intervention program was conducted with nine adults from a cerebral palsy center who exercised weekly in 20-min sessions. Findings demonstrated a significant increase in balance and gait function scores resulting in indicators of greater independence for our participating adults. Scores improved from 16 to 21 points in a scale of 28, according to the Tinetti Scale for risk of falls, moving from high fall risk to moderate fall risk. Our promising results indicate that our experimental system is feasible for balance rehabilitation therapy. © 2013 IEEE. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Balance Rehabilitation; Cerebral Palsy; Serious-games; Vision-based Interaction; Biofeedback; Physical Therapy; Balance Rehabilitations; Cerebral Palsy; Interaction Technology; Intervention Programs; Prototype Development; Rehabilitation System; Serious-games; Vision-based Interaction; Diseases; Adult; Aged; Algorithm; Article; Body Equilibrium; Body Posture; Cerebral Palsy; Computer Program; Female; Gait; Game; Hemispheric Dominance; Human; Kinesiotherapy; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Physiologic Monitoring; Physiology; Physiotherapy; Recreation; Treatment Outcome; Vestibular Test; Young Adult; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Cerebral Palsy; Exercise Therapy; Female; Functional Laterality; Gait; Games, Experimental; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Physiologic; Motivation; Physical Therapy Modalities; Postural Balance; Posture; Software; Treatment Outcome; Vestibular Function Tests; Video Games; Young Adult","Biofeedback; Physical therapy; Balance rehabilitations; Cerebral palsy; Interaction technology; Intervention programs; Prototype development; Rehabilitation System; serious-games; Vision-based interaction; Diseases; adult; aged; algorithm; article; body equilibrium; body posture; cerebral palsy; computer program; female; gait; game; hemispheric dominance; human; kinesiotherapy; male; middle aged; motivation; physiologic monitoring; physiology; physiotherapy; recreation; treatment outcome; vestibular test; young adult; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Cerebral Palsy; Exercise Therapy; Female; Functional Laterality; Gait; Games, Experimental; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Physiologic; Motivation; Physical Therapy Modalities; Postural Balance; Posture; Software; Treatment Outcome; Vestibular Function Tests; Video Games; Young Adult"

It has been observed that the physically disabled persons typically lack enthusiasm for rehabilitation. This hinders their recovery and ability to care for themselves. Using research and recommendations from therapists, we developed a product, Kinect-o-Therapy, that involved implementation of exercise routines targeting different parts of the body and aided people with motor disabilities stemming from cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, post stroke and hereditary muscle ailments amongst others. Kinect-o-Therapy incorporates serious games that process 3D input using the Microsoft Kinect motion sensor to build an effective rehabilitation system. It is a plug-and-play type product that gives feedback to the patient and the doctors to monitor performance. The game environment and feedback mechanism ensure patients involvement and high motivation to carry out these exercise routines regularly.

We further investigated if cognitive capacity and motor impairment influenced game performance. Nineteen children with neurological gait disorders (mean age: 13.4y, 42% girls) participated. To quantify game participation, electromyographic muscle activity (M. rectus femoris) and heart rate were compared in a demanding part and a less demanding part of the game. Cognitive capacity was assessed with the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence (TONI-4). Furthermore, the Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM), Manual Muscle Tests and a therapist-derived score of how well the child was able to train were assessed. Results showed that muscle activity and heart rate were higher during the demanding part of the game (30.7. ±. 22.6. μV; 129.4. ±. 15.7. bpm) compared to the less demanding part (16.0. ±. 13.4. μV; 124.1. ±. 15.9. bpm; p<. 0.01 for both measures). Game performance correlated moderately with the TONI-4 (r= 0.50, p = 0.04) and the cognition subscale of the WeeFIM (ρ= 0.59, p= 0.01). The therapist-derived score correlated significantly with game performance (p= 0.75, p<. 0.01) and the ability to modify muscle activity to the demands of the game (p= -0.72, p<. 0.01). Receiver operating characteristic analyses revealed that the latter factor differentiated well between those children suitable for the game and those not. We conclude that children with neurological gait disorders are able to modify their activity to the demands of the VR-scenario. However, cognitive function and motor impairment determine to which extent. These results are important for clinical decision-making. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cerebral Palsy; Emg; Heart Rate; Lokomat; Motor Learning; Muscle Activation Pattern; Receiver Operating Characteristics; Therapy; Walking; Adolescent; Adult; Article; Ataxic Gait; Cerebral Palsy; Cerebrovascular Accident; Child; Clinical Article; Clinical Decision Making; Clinical Evaluation; Cognition; Correlation Analysis; Demyelinating Disease; Electromyography; Female; Functional Independence Measure For Children; Gait Orthosis; Game; Heart Rate; Human; Intelligence Test; Male; Manual Muscle Test; Meningomyelocele; Motor Dysfunction; Muscle Contraction; Named Inventories, Questionnaires And Rating Scales; Neurologic Gait Disorder; Patient Participation; Physical Performance; Preschool Child; Psychotherapist; Receiver Operating Characteristic; Rectus Femoris Muscle; Robotics; School Child; Test Of Nonverbal Intelligence; Traumatic Brain Injury; Virtual Reality; Cerebral Palsy; Emg; Heart Rate; Lokomat; Motor Learning; Muscle Activation Pattern; Receiver Operating Characteristics; Therapy; Walking; Adolescent; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Child, Preschool; Electromyography; Exercise Therapy; Female; Gait Disorders, Neurologic; Humans; Male; Orthotic Devices; Quadriceps Muscle; Robotics; Roc Curve; Therapy, Computer-assisted; User-computer Interface; Young Adult","adolescent; adult; article; ataxic gait; cerebral palsy; cerebrovascular accident; child; clinical article; clinical decision making; clinical evaluation; cognition; correlation analysis; demyelinating disease; electromyography; female; Functional Independence Measure for Children; gait orthosis; game; heart rate; human; intelligence test; male; Manual Muscle Test; meningomyelocele; motor dysfunction; muscle contraction; named inventories, questionnaires and rating scales; neurologic gait disorder; patient participation; physical performance; preschool child; psychotherapist; receiver operating characteristic; rectus femoris muscle; robotics; school child; Test of Nonverbal Intelligence; traumatic brain injury; virtual reality; Cerebral palsy; EMG; Heart rate; Lokomat; Motor learning; Muscle activation pattern; Receiver operating characteristics; Therapy; Walking; Adolescent; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Child, Preschool; Electromyography; Exercise Therapy; Female; Gait Disorders, Neurologic; Humans; Male; Orthotic Devices; Quadriceps Muscle; Robotics; ROC Curve; Therapy, Computer-Assisted; User-Computer Interface; Young Adult"

Research in rehabilitation science has demonstrated that movement recovery is facilitated by extended task practice. However, 75% of stroke survivors are unable to successfully practice reaching tasks, due to the severity of the impairment of elbow and wrist movements. We hypothesize that expert action observation - observing normal avatar movement in response to impaired UE movement - may promote greater brain learning and contribute to greater UE movement recovery for patients with severe limitations of elbow and wrist movement. To incorporate extended task practice and expert action observation into current therapy, we have developed and begun initial exploratory testing of Duck Duck Punch, a 3D serious game for stroke neurorehabilitation. A Microsoft Kinect motion tracking sensor allows a stroke survivor to interact with the virtual game by moving their impaired arm. The visual display of a corresponding avatar arm enables a patient with impaired movement in the real world to appear to have normal movement in the virtual game environment. Data from a preliminary study suggests that our system may be effective in aiding in rehabilitation, especially in improving reaching efficiency and reducing abnormal movements. © 2013 IEEE. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Abnormal Movement; Exploratory Testing; Feasibility Studies; Microsoft Kinect; Motor Impairments; Neurorehabilitation; Stroke Survivors; Upper Extremity; Neuromuscular Rehabilitation; Three Dimensional; User Interfaces,Abnormal movement; Exploratory testing; Feasibility studies; Microsoft kinect; Motor impairments; Neurorehabilitation; Stroke survivors; Upper extremity; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Three dimensional; User interfaces

In this paper, the authors want to validate the availability of IntelligentBox for the prototype development of movie-based physical therapy games that require simple body actions such as dances. Although physical therapy games needs various types of inputs for human body actions, IntelligentBox has already supported a video-based motion input, a motion capture system input, a data-glove input and so on. Also, physical therapy games need much tuning according to each of rehabilitants because their physical disability levels are different. Therefore, therapists have to frequently change many parameters such as a body action speed, difficulty levels of body actions, etc. For this point, the component-based approach is significant. To validate this, the authors introduce one of the simple dance games as physical therapy games actually being developed using IntelligentBox. © 2012 ACM. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",3d Graphics; Component Ware; Games; Intelligentbox; Toolkit; 3d Graphics; Component Ware; Games; Intelligentbox; Toolkit; Interactive Computer Graphics; Motion Pictures; Three Dimensional Computer Graphics; Visual Communication; Physical Therapy,3D graphics; Component ware; games; IntelligentBox; toolkit; Interactive computer graphics; Motion pictures; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visual communication; Physical therapy

In general, stroke rehabilitation is a process which requires intensive direct physical therapy and is usually guided by physiotherapists. The long and intensive therapy sessions often results in patients losing the motivation to continue with the therapy, and as a result patients do not recover to their prospective. With increasing occurrence of stroke incidence, therapists are under pressure for time. At present most of the rehabilitation programmes are highly human intensive. Thus an innovative game technology that supports stroke rehabilitation may provide new opportunities. The main objective of this paper is to present a new low cost game framework for stroke rehabilitation programme that would increase patients' motivation for therapy, and also to study the feasibility and effect of a new game based technology to support hand and leg rehabilitation. In this paper, some important new game design principles for hand and leg rehabilitation with a standard angle based representation of the full body motion during exercise, for improving the accuracy of stroke exercise are presented.

The use of computers to achieve engagement and motivation has been sought as a medium that not only give entertainment but real therapy benefits. The use of some interaction devices (such as mouse) however is a limiting feature to some patients with motor disabilities. Existing camera-based games do not reason with the whole spectrum of movements required by therapy. Recent development and popularization of depth cameras made it possible to develop interfaces that can explore users' 3D movements with no device to hold. This paper presents a game-like virtual environment where controllable situations are generated and users limitations are considered in order to foster movements on an interesting and relaxed set of activities. The development has shown that a close collaboration between physiotherapists and computer scientists are mandatory in order to achieve a useful application. © 2012 IEEE. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Depth Camera; Games; Rehabilitation; Virtual Reality; Computer Scientists; Depth Camera; Games; Interaction Devices; Motor Disability; Virtual Rehabilitation; Augmented Reality; Cameras; Patient Rehabilitation; Three Dimensional Computer Graphics; Virtual Reality; Patient Treatment,Computer scientists; Depth camera; Games; Interaction devices; Motor disability; Virtual rehabilitation; Augmented reality; Cameras; Patient rehabilitation; Three dimensional computer graphics; Virtual reality; Patient treatment

The games are intended to be used with the Pediatric Anklebot and provide an interactive environment to the assist-as-needed robotic therapy for children with Cerebral Palsy ages 5 to 8. As with the games developed for the MIT-Manus robot, the SGs are visually-guided, visually-evoked, easy to play with, and promote training of the impaired ankle in dorsi-plantar flexion and inversion-eversion. The games' goal is to reinforce meaningful play and challenge.

However, the inclusion of games in the curricula can threaten the universal right to education for students with disabilities if they are not designed to be accessible. In this paper we discuss the need for tools that assist educators and educational content providers in producing games that are equally accessible for all. The goal is to minimize the cost and effort needed for introducing accessibility in serious games. We discuss to what extent the process of making a serious game accessible can be automated and supported by software tools that minimize human intervention. We conclude that there is a set of common accessibility barriers, especially those related to interaction and physical disabilities, that can be addressed systematically in a high proportion and therefore could be dealt with by software. Other problems, especially those more close to structure, storyboard and design, still need direct intervention from the game authors, but could be facilitated with appropriate methodologies and auditing tools. © 2012 Springer-Verlag. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Accessibility; Educational Games; Serious Games; Universal Design; Accessibility; Accessibility Barriers; Educational Contents; Educational Game; Game Development; Human Intervention; Physical Disability; Serious Games; Universal Design; Curricula; Design; E-learning; Handicapped Persons; Learning Systems; Software Design,accessibility; Accessibility barriers; Educational contents; Educational game; Game development; Human intervention; Physical disability; Serious games; Universal Design; Curricula; Design; E-learning; Handicapped persons; Learning systems; Software design

Longer interventions are facilitated if training is provided in the patient's home, due to easier access to care and reduced impact on school or work activities. Providing remote rehabilitation over lengthy periods of time has however its own challenges. This paper presents two pediatric patients with hemiplegia, who practiced virtual hand rehabilitation games using a modified PlayStation 3 and 5DT sensing gloves. Despite severe initial hand spasticity, and occasional technology shortcomings, the subjects practiced for about 14 months, and 6 months, respectively. Game performance data for the second patient is presented. Follow-up evaluations 14 months from the removal of the PlayStation 3 from the home of the child with cerebral palsy showed that the patient had good retention in terms of grasp strength, hand function and bone health.

In this context, physiotherapists and occupational therapy are important elements of stroke rehabilitation. Applications from such exploratory development reflect motivational and easy to use features, which could be further designed and developed by serious games developers. This research study aims to investigate the role and usefulness of Video Capture Virtual Reality Technology (VCVRT) in motor impairment rehabilitation, to identify and explore the importance of this technology in healthcare, specifically in motor impairment rehabilitation. Likewise, to analyze the acceptance of VCVRT among the physiotherapists in terms of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and perceived intension to use. Results imply that video capture virtual reality technology can be use as complement to conventional physiotherapy. This technology is cheap, easy to use and is useful as a home based rehabilitation tool, but together with physiotherapist supervision or coaching. Moreover, VCVRT is motivational for weak patients and useful in motor rehabilitation in terms of quantity, i.e. intensity of exercise can be increased. Physiotherapist centered approach is necessary for game design process; effective game design suggestions and the idea of single gaming framework consists of different games acquiring multiple rehabilitation goals, are achieved from physiotherapists during the research. Technology acceptance value is high among physiotherapists.

In this paper we summarise previous work in our group using virtual reality technology and webcam-based games. We then present early work we are conducting in experimenting with desktop augmented reality (AR) for rehabilitation. AR allows the user to use real objects to interact with computer-generated environments. Markers attached to the real objects enable the system (via a webcam) to track the position and orientation of each object as it is moved. The system can then augment the captured image of the real environment with computer-generated graphics to present a variety of game or task-driven scenarios to the user. We discuss the development of rehabilitation prototypes using available AR libraries and express our thoughts on the potential of AR technology. © 2010 IEEE. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Augmented Reality; Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Stroke; Video-capture; Physical Disability; Physical Rehabilitation; Real Environments; Real Objects; Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Stroke Rehabilitation; Task-driven; Upper Limbs; Virtual Reality Technology; Argon; Augmented Reality; Virtual Reality,Physical disability; Physical rehabilitation; Real environments; Real objects; Rehabilitation; Serious games; Stroke rehabilitation; Task-driven; Upper limbs; Virtual reality technology; Argon; Augmented reality; Virtual reality

Today dozens of studies that are proving the efficacy of digital game-based learning and how it can improve learning (e.g. Does game-based learning work? Results from three recent studies, Richard Blunt) has been done. There is a big difference between traditional learning and learning with videogames. While traditional learning's objective is ""what you learn"", learning with videogames encloses ""HOW YOU LEARN"" as well! This method of learning can provide the information in an amusing, realistic and interactive way. Students who often use educational games say: ""You don't even know that you are learning""! Many researches in recent years has been done on how that videogames can improve learning (""Don't Bother Me Mom - I'm Learning!"", Marc Prensky; ""Serious Games: Games That Educate, Train, and Inform"", Michael D. & Chen S; ""What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy"", James Paul Gee). The question ""How can we integrate videogames in our educational system?"" is the main issue today. If we want to integrate a new educational tool, we have to take in account one of the important pillars of our educational system: ""Everybody has to have access to education"". It will be a great challenge to foresee access to educational videogames for all kind of students. We are sure that a regular student has no problems to access and use videogames. But what if a students with a disability wants to play video games? We can divide students with disabilities into 4 groups: Learning disability, Visual disability, Auditory disability, Physical disability. For some categories, like visual or auditory disabilities, it is hard to find some solutions to have access to videogames because a videogame mainly consists of visuals and audio. In this paper we will take a closer look at some possibilities how students with disabilities also can benefit from educational games. We will discuss some concrete examples for every group of disability. Developing games for these specific students does not always mean that we have to create totally different games. Some of the special built-in features can also be useful for a regular student. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Disabilities; Learning; Special Needs; Videogames; Human Computer Interaction; Interactive Computer Graphics; Learning Systems; Digital Game-based Learning; Disabilities; Game-based Learning; Learning; Learning Disabilities; Special Needs; Traditional Learning; Video Game; Students,Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Learning systems; Digital game-based learning; Disabilities; Game-based Learning; Learning; Learning disabilities; Special needs; Traditional learning; Video game; Students

This paper discusses why games may be an effective way of addressing the problem of engagement in therapy and analyses which game design patterns may be important for rehabilitation. We present a number of serious games that our group has developed for upper limb rehabilitation. Results of an evaluation of the games are presented which indicate that they may be appropriate for people with stroke. © 2009 IEEE. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Nintendo Wii; Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Stroke; Video-capture; Virtual Reality; Nintendo Wii; Rehabilitation; Serious Games; Stroke; Video-capture; Patient Rehabilitation; Virtual Reality; Game Theory,Nintendo Wii; Rehabilitation; Serious games; Stroke; Video-capture; Patient rehabilitation; Virtual reality; Game theory

By introducing an element of fun, these systems aim at increasing patients' motivation to train and, from a further perspective, improve recovery rates. There is, however, a question whether such tools will be fully accepted by the intended target group. Earlier work on user acceptance has mainly focused on utility systems, i.e. systems used mainly in the work place. However, people use systems for different reasons and that makes it difficult to apply the same principles on systems with the main purpose to entertain. Serious games have characteristics from both utility and entertainment systems, which makes it interesting to study the acceptance of these kinds of systems. In this study, we have developed a home-based entertainment system for stroke rehabilitation, with focus on rehabilitation of motor impairments. By analysing the gaming behaviour and interview responses of five stroke patients, we investigate factors influencing user acceptance of this specific type of system. The results show that current models of acceptance are not sufficient to fully explain acceptance of serious games in general and serious games for rehabilitation in particular. Besides well-known factors, such as perceived usefulness, perceived ease-of-use and perceived enjoyment, other, more specific, factors also play a vital role in the acceptance of the system. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Serious Games; Stroke; Technology Acceptance Model (tam); User Acceptance; Virtual Rehabilitation; Cognitive Systems; E-learning; Patient Rehabilitation; Entertainment Systems; Game-based; Physical Impairments; Stroke; Stroke Rehabilitation; Technology Acceptance Model; Users' Acceptance; Utility Systems; Virtual Rehabilitation; Serious Games,Cognitive systems; E-learning; Patient rehabilitation; Entertainment systems; Game-Based; Physical impairments; Stroke; Stroke rehabilitation; Technology acceptance model; Users' acceptance; Utility systems; Virtual rehabilitation; Serious games

The game was developed through a participatory design process involving therapists and children from the target user group. The game is implemented on top of a platform that supports the implementation of tangible user interfaces using sensing technology. We argue that physical interaction, motivated and constrained by the design of tangible interfaces, offers enormous potential for occupational and physical therapy where patients need to practice specific and repetitive movements. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cerebral Palsy; Children; Serious Games; Table-top; Tangible Interfaces; Therapy; Diseases; Patient Treatment; User Interfaces; Cerebral Palsy; Children; Table-top; Tangible Interfaces; Therapy; Serious Games,Diseases; Patient treatment; User interfaces; Cerebral palsy; Children; Table-top; Tangible interfaces; Therapy; Serious games
